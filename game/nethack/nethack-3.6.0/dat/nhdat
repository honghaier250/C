        Welcome to NetHack!                ( description of version 3.6 )

        NetHack is a Dungeons and Dragons like game where you (the adventurer)
descend into the depths of the dungeon in search of the Amulet of Yendor,
reputed to be hidden somewhere below the twentieth level.  You begin your
adventure with a pet that can help you in many ways, and can be trained
to do all sorts of things.  On the way you will find useful (or useless)
items, quite possibly with magic properties, and assorted monsters.  You can
attack a monster by trying to move onto the space a monster is on (but often
it is much wiser to leave it alone).

        Unlike most adventure games, which give you a verbal description of
your location, NetHack gives you a visual image of the dungeon level you are
on.

        NetHack uses the following symbols:

        - and |  The walls of a room, possibly also open doors or a grave.
        .        The floor of a room or a doorway.
        #        A corridor, or iron bars, or a tree, or possibly a kitchen
                 sink (if your dungeon has sinks), or a drawbridge.
        >        Stairs down: a way to the next level.
        <        Stairs up: a way to the previous level.
        @        You (usually), or another human.
        )        A weapon of some sort.
        [        A suit or piece of armor.
        %        Something edible (not necessarily healthy).
        /        A wand.
        =        A ring.
        ?        A scroll.
        !        A potion.
        (        Some other useful object (pick-axe, key, lamp...)
        $        A pile of gold.
        *        A gem or rock (possibly valuable, possibly worthless).
        +        A closed door, or a spellbook containing a spell
                 you can learn.
        ^        A trap (once you detect it).
        "        An amulet, or a spider web.
        0        An iron ball.
        _        An altar, or an iron chain.
        {        A fountain.
        }        A pool of water or moat or a pool of lava.
        \        An opulent throne.
        `        A boulder or statue.
        A to Z, a to z, and several others:  Monsters.
        I        Invisible or unseen monster's last known location

                 You can find out what a symbol represents by typing
                 '/' and following the directions to move the cursor
                 to the symbol in question.  For instance, a 'd' may
                 turn out to be a dog.


y k u   7 8 9   Move commands:
 \|/     \|/            yuhjklbn: go one step in specified direction
h-.-l   4-.-6           YUHJKLBN: go in specified direction until you
 /|\     /|\                        hit a wall or run into something
b j n   1 2 3           g<dir>:   run in direction <dir> until something
      numberpad                     interesting is seen
                        G<dir>,   same, except a branching corridor isn't
 <  up                  ^<dir>:     considered interesting (the ^ in this
                                    case means the Control key, not a caret)
 >  down                m<dir>:   move without picking up objects
                        F<dir>:   fight even if you don't sense a monster
                If the number_pad option is set, the number keys move instead.
                Depending on the platform, Shift number (on the numberpad),
                Meta number, or Alt number will invoke the YUHJKLBN commands.
                Control <dir> may or may not work when number_pad is enabled,
                depending on the platform's capabilities.
                Digit '5' acts as 'G' prefix, unless number_pad is set to 2
                in which case it acts as 'g' instead.
                If number_pad is set to 3, the roles of 1,2,3 and 7,8,9 are
                reversed; when set to 4, behaves same as 3 combined with 2.
                If number_pad is set to -1, alphabetic movement commands are
                used but 'y' and 'z' are swapped.

Commands:
        NetHack knows the following commands:
        ?       Help menu.
        /       Tell what a symbol represents.  You may choose to specify
                a location or give a symbol argument.
        &       Tell what a command does.
        <       Go up a staircase (if you are standing on it).
        >       Go down a staircase (if you are standing on it).
        .       Rest, do nothing for one turn.
        _       Travel via a shortest-path algorithm to a point on the map.
        a       Apply (use) a tool (pick-axe, key, lamp...).
        A       Remove all armor.
        ^A      Redo the previous command.
        c       Close a door.
        C       Call (name) monster, individual object, or type of object.
        d       Drop something.  d7a:  drop seven items of object a.
        D       Drop multiple items.  This command is implemented in two
                different ways.  One way is:
                "D" displays a list of all of your items, from which you can
                pick and choose what to drop.  A "+" next to an item means
                that it will be dropped, a "-" means that it will not be
                dropped.  Toggle an item to be selected/deselected by typing
                the letter adjacent to its description.  Select all items
                with "+", deselect all items with "=".  The <SPACEBAR> moves
                you from one page of the listing to the next.
                The other way is:
                "D" will ask the question "What kinds of things do you want
                to drop? [!%= au]".  You should type zero or more object
                symbols possibly followed by 'a' and/or 'u'.
                Da - drop all objects, without asking for confirmation.
                Du - drop only unpaid objects (when in a shop).
                D%u - drop only unpaid food.
        ^D      Kick (for doors, usually).
        e       Eat food.
        E       Engrave a message on the floor.
                E- - write in the dust with your fingers.
        f       Fire ammunition from quiver.
        F       Followed by direction, fight a monster (even if you don't
                sense it).
        i       Display your inventory.
        I       Display selected parts of your inventory, as in
                I* - list all gems in inventory.
                Iu - list all unpaid items.
                Ix - list all used up items that are on your shopping bill.
                I$ - count your money.
        o       Open a door.
        O       Review current options and possibly change them.
                A menu displaying the option settings will be displayed
                and most can be changed by simply selecting their entry.
                Options are usually set before the game with a NETHACKOPTIONS
                environment variable, or via a config file (defaults.nh,
                NetHack Defaults, nethack.cnf, .nethackrc, etc.), not with 
                the 'O' command.
        p       Pay your shopping bill.
        P       Put on an accessory (ring, amulet, etc).
        ^P      Repeat last message (subsequent ^P's repeat earlier messages).
                The behavior can be varied via the msg_window option.
        q       Drink (quaff) something (potion, water, etc).
        Q       Select ammunition for quiver.
        r       Read a scroll or spellbook.
        R       Remove an accessory (ring, amulet, etc).
        ^R      Redraw the screen.
        s       Search for secret doors and traps around you.
        S       Save the game.
        t       Throw an object or shoot a projectile.
        T       Take off armor.
        ^T      Teleport, if you are able.
        v       Displays the version number.
        V       Display a longer identification of the version, including the
                history of the game.
        w       Wield weapon.  w- means wield nothing, use bare hands.
        W       Wear armor.
        x       Swap wielded and secondary weapons.
        X       Toggle two-weapon combat.
        ^X      Show your attributes.
        z       Zap a wand.  (Use y instead of z if number_pad is -1.)
        Z       Cast a spell.  (Use Y instead of Z if number_pad is -1.)
        ^Z      Suspend the game.  (^Y instead of ^Z if number_pad is -1.)
        :       Look at what is here.
        ;       Look at what is somewhere else.
        ,       Pick up some things.

        #       Introduces one of the "extended" commands.  To get a list of
                the commands you can use with "#" type "#?".  The extended
                commands you can use depends upon what options the game was
                compiled with, along with your class and what type of monster
                you most closely resemble at a given moment.  If your keyboard
                has a meta key (which, when pressed in combination with another
                key, modifies it by setting the 'meta' (8th, or 'high') bit),
                these extended commands can be invoked by meta-ing the first
                letter of the command.  An alt key may have a similar effect.

        If the "number_pad" option is on, some additional letter commands
        are available:

        h       displays the help menu, like '?'
        j       Jump to another location.
        k       Kick (for doors, usually).
        l       Loot a box on the floor.
        n       followed by number of times to repeat the next command.
        N       Name a monster, an individual object, or a type of object.
        u       Untrap a trapped object or door.

        You can put a number before a command to repeat it that many times,
        as in "40." or "20s.".  If you have the number_pad option set, you
        must type 'n' to prefix the count, as in "n40." or "n20s".


        Some information is displayed on the bottom line or perhaps in a
        box, depending on the platform you are using.  You see your
        attributes, your alignment, what dungeon level you are on, how many
        hit points you have now (and will have when fully recovered), what
        your armor class is (the lower the better), your experience level,
        and the state of your stomach.  Optionally, you may or may not see
        other information such as spell points, how much gold you have, etc.

        Have Fun, and Happy Hacking!

NetHack History file for release 3.6

Behold, mortal, the origins of NetHack...

Jay Fenlason wrote the original Hack with help from Kenny Woodland,
Mike Thome, and Jon Payne.

Andries Brouwer did a major re-write, transforming Hack into a very different
game, and published (at least) three versions (1.0.1, 1.0.2, and 1.0.3) for
UNIX(tm) machines to the Usenet.

Don G. Kneller ported Hack 1.0.3 to Microsoft(tm) C and MS-DOS(tm), producing
PC HACK 1.01e, added support for DEC Rainbow graphics in version 1.03g, and
went on to produce at least four more versions (3.0, 3.2, 3.51, and 3.6;
note that these are old Hack version numbers, not contemporary NetHack ones).

R. Black ported PC HACK 3.51 to Lattice(tm) C and the Atari 520/1040ST,
producing ST Hack 1.03.

Mike Stephenson merged these various versions back together, incorporating
many of the added features, and produced NetHack version 1.4 in 1987.  He
then coordinated a cast of thousands in enhancing and debugging NetHack 1.4
and released NetHack versions 2.2 and 2.3.

Later, Mike coordinated a major rewrite of the game, heading a team which
included Ken Arromdee, Jean-Christophe Collet, Steve Creps, Eric Hendrickson,
Izchak Miller, Eric S. Raymond, John Rupley, Mike Threepoint, and Janet Walz,
to produce NetHack 3.0c.  The same group subsequently released ten patch-
level revisions and updates of 3.0.

NetHack 3.0 was ported to the Atari by Eric R. Smith, to OS/2 by Timo
Hakulinen, and to VMS by David Gentzel.  The three of them and Kevin Darcy
later joined the main development team to produce subsequent revisions of
3.0.

Olaf Seibert ported NetHack 2.3 and 3.0 to the Amiga.  Norm Meluch, Stephen
Spackman and Pierre Martineau designed overlay code for PC NetHack 3.0.
Johnny Lee ported NetHack 3.0 to the Macintosh.  Along with various other
Dungeoneers, they continued to enhance the PC, Macintosh, and Amiga ports
through the later revisions of 3.0.

Headed by Mike Stephenson and coordinated by Izchak Miller and Janet Walz,
the development team which now included Ken Arromdee, David Cohrs,
Jean-Christophe Collet, Kevin Darcy, Matt Day, Timo Hakulinen, Steve Linhart,
Dean Luick, Pat Rankin, Eric Raymond, and Eric Smith undertook a radical
revision of 3.0.  They re-structured the game's design, and re-wrote major
parts of the code.  They added multiple dungeons, a new display, special
individual character quests, a new endgame and many other new features, and
produced NetHack 3.1.

Ken Lorber, Gregg Wonderly and Greg Olson, with help from Richard Addison,
Mike Passaretti, and Olaf Seibert, developed NetHack 3.1 for the Amiga.

Norm Meluch and Kevin Smolkowski, with help from Carl Schelin, Stephen
Spackman, Steve VanDevender, and Paul Winner, ported NetHack 3.1 to the PC.

Jon W{tte and Hao-yang Wang, with help from Ross Brown, Mike Engber, David
Hairston, Michael Hamel, Jonathan Handler, Johnny Lee, Tim Lennan, Rob Menke,
and Andy Swanson developed NetHack 3.1 for the Macintosh, porting it for
MPW.  Building on their development, Barton House added a Think C port.

Timo Hakulinen ported NetHack 3.1 to OS/2.  Eric Smith ported NetHack 3.1
to the Atari.  Pat Rankin, with help from Joshua Delahunty, is responsible
for the VMS version of NetHack 3.1.  Michael Allison ported NetHack 3.1 to
Windows NT.

Dean Luick, with help from David Cohrs, developed NetHack 3.1 for X11.
Warwick Allison wrote a tiled version of NetHack for the Atari;
he later contributed the tiles to the DevTeam and tile support was
then added to other platforms.

The 3.2 development team, comprised of Michael Allison, Ken Arromdee, David
Cohrs, Jessie Collet, Steve Creps, Kevin Darcy, Timo Hakulinen, Steve
Linhart, Dean Luick, Pat Rankin, Eric Smith, Mike Stephenson, Janet Walz, and
Paul Winner, released version 3.2 in April of 1996.

Version 3.2 marked the tenth anniversary of the formation of the development
team.  In a testament to their dedication to the game, all thirteen members
of the original development team remained on the team at the start of work
on that release.  During the interval between the release of 3.1.3 and 3.2,
one of the founding members of the development team, Dr. Izchak Miller,
passed away.  That release of the game was dedicated to him by the
development and porting teams.

Version 3.2 proved to be more stable than previous versions.  Many bugs
were fixed, abuses eliminated, and game features tuned for better game
play.

During the lifespan of NetHack 3.1 and 3.2, several enthusiasts of the game
added their own modifications to the game and made these "variants" publicly
available:

Tom Proudfoot and Yuval Oren created NetHack++, which was quickly renamed
NetHack--.  Working independently, Stephen White wrote NetHack Plus.
Tom Proudfoot later merged NetHack Plus and his own NetHack-- to produce
SLASH.  Larry Stewart-Zerba and Warwick Allison improved the spellcasting
system with the Wizard Patch.  Warwick Allison also ported NetHack to use
the Qt interface.

Warren Cheung combined SLASH with the Wizard Patch to produce Slash'em, and
with the help of Kevin Hugo, added more features.  Kevin later joined the
DevTeam and incorporated the best of these ideas in NetHack 3.3.

The final update to 3.2 was the bug fix release 3.2.3, which was released
simultaneously with 3.3.0 in December 1999 just in time for the Year 2000.

The 3.3 development team, consisting of Michael Allison, Ken Arromdee,
David Cohrs, Jessie Collet, Steve Creps, Kevin Darcy, Timo Hakulinen,
Kevin Hugo, Steve Linhart, Ken Lorber, Dean Luick, Pat Rankin, Eric Smith,
Mike Stephenson, Janet Walz, and Paul Winner, released 3.3.0 in
December 1999 and 3.3.1 in August of 2000.

Version 3.3 offered many firsts. It was the first version to separate race
and profession. The Elf class was removed in preference to an elf race,
and the races of dwarves, gnomes, and orcs made their first appearance in
the game alongside the familiar human race.  Monk and Ranger roles joined
Archeologists, Barbarians, Cavemen, Healers, Knights, Priests, Rogues,
Samurai, Tourists, Valkyries and of course, Wizards.  It was also the first
version to allow you to ride a steed, and was the first version to have a
publicly available web-site listing all the bugs that had been discovered.
Despite that constantly growing bug list, 3.3 proved stable enough to last
for more than a year and a half.

The 3.4 development team initially consisted of Michael Allison, Ken Arromdee,
David Cohrs, Jessie Collet, Kevin Hugo, Ken Lorber, Dean Luick, Pat Rankin,
Mike Stephenson, Janet Walz, and Paul Winner, with Warwick Allison joining
just before the release of NetHack 3.4.0 in March 2002.

As with version 3.3, various people contributed to the game as a whole as
well as supporting ports on the different platforms that NetHack runs on:

Pat Rankin maintained 3.4 for VMS.

Michael Allison maintained NetHack 3.4 for the MS-DOS platform.
Paul Winner and Yitzhak Sapir provided encouragement.

Dean Luick, Mark Modrall, and Kevin Hugo maintained and enhanced the
Macintosh port of 3.4.

Michael Allison, David Cohrs, Alex Kompel, Dion Nicolaas, and Yitzhak Sapir
maintained and enhanced 3.4 for the Microsoft Windows platform.  Alex Kompel
contributed a new graphical interface for the Windows port.  Alex Kompel also
contributed a Windows CE port for 3.4.1.

Ron Van Iwaarden maintained 3.4 for OS/2.

Janne Salmijarvi and Teemu Suikki maintained and enhanced the
Amiga port of 3.5 after Janne Salmijarvi resurrected it for 3.3.1.

Christian `Marvin' Bressler maintained 3.5 for the Atari after he
resurrected it for 3.3.1.

The release of NetHack 3.4.3 in December 2003 marked the beginning of a
long release hiatus.  3.4.3 proved to be a remarkably stable version that
provided continued enjoyment by the community for more than a decade.  The
devteam slowly and quietly continued to work on the game behind the scenes
during the tenure of 3.4.3.  It was during that same period that several
new variants emerged within the NetHack community.  Notably sporkhack by
Derek S. Ray, unnethack by Patric Mueller, nitrohack and its successors
originally by Daniel Thaler and then by Alex Smith, and
Dynahack by Tung Nguyen.  Some of those variants continue to be developed,
maintained, and enjoyed by the community to this day.

In September 2014, an interim snapshot of the code under development was
released publicly by other parties.  Since that code was a work-in-progress
and had not gone through a period of debugging, it was decided that the
version numbers present on that code snapshot would be retired and never
used in an official NetHack release.  An announcement was posted on the
devteam's official nethack.org website to that effect, stating that there
would never be a 3.4.4, 3.5, or 3.5.0 official release version.

In January 2015, preparation began for the release of NetHack 3.6.

At the beginning of development for what would eventually get released
as 3.6.0, the development team consisted of Michael Allison,
Warwick Allison, Ken Arromdee, David Cohrs, Jessie Collet, Ken Lorber,
Dean Luick, Pat Rankin, Mike Stephenson, Janet Walz, and Paul Winner.
Leading up to the release of 3.6.0 in early 2015, new members Sean Hunt,
Pasi Kallinen, and Derek S. Ray joined the NetHack development team.

In January 2015, preparation began for the release of NetHack 3.6.  The 3.6
version merges work done by the development team since the previous release
with some of the beloved community patches.  Many bugs were fixed and some
code was restructured.

The development team, as well as Steve VanDevender and Kevin Smolkowski
ensured that NetHack 3.6.0 continued to operate on various Unix flavors
as well as maintaining the X11 interface.

Ken Lorber, Haoyang Wang, Pat Rankin, and Dean Luick maintained the port
of NetHack 3.6.0 for Mac.

Michael Allison, Derek S. Ray, Yitzhak Sapir, Alex Kompel, Dion Nicolaas,
and David Cohrs maintained the port of NetHack 3.6.0 for Microsoft Windows.

Pat Rankin attempted to keep the VMS port running for NetHack 3.6.0,
hindered by limited access.  Kevin Smolkowski has updated and tested it
for the most recent version of OpenVMS (V8.4 as of this writing) on Alpha
and Integrity (aka Itanium aka IA64) but not VAX.

This version of the game is special in a particular way.  Near the end of
the development of 3.6, one of the significant inspirations for many of
the humorous and fun features found in the game, author Terry Pratchett,
passed away.  This version of the game includes a tribute to him.


An official NetHack web site continues to be maintained by Ken Lorber at
http://www.nethack.org/.

SHOUT-OUTS

The devteam would like to give a special "shout-out" to thank the generous
people primarily responsible for the public NetHack servers available for
playing the game at nethack.alt.org and devnull.net.  In addition to
providing a way for the public to play a game of NetHack from almost
anywhere, they have hosted annual NetHack tournaments for many, many years.

On behalf of the NetHack community, thank you very much to
M. Drew Streib, Pasi Kallinen and Robin Bandy.

           recovery after program crash

Boolean option if NEWS was set at compile time:
news       print any news from game administrator on startup      [TRUE]

Boolean option if MFLOPPY was set at compile time:
checkspace check free disk space before writing files to disk     [TRUE]


Boolean option if SCORE_ON_BOTL was set at compile time:
showscore  display your approximate accumulated score             [FALSE]

Boolean options if TEXTCOLOR was set at compile time:
color      use different colors for objects on screen   [TRUE for micros]
hilite_pet display pets in a highlighted manner                   [FALSE]

Boolean option if TIMED_DELAY was set at compile time (tty interface only):
timed_delay    on unix and VMS, use a timer instead of sending
               extra screen output when attempting to pause for
               display effect.  on MSDOS without the termcap
               lib, whether or not to pause for visual effect.    [TRUE]

Boolean option for Amiga, or for others if ALTMETA was set at compile time:

               obtains a command from player's keyboard.          [FALSE]

Boolean option if USE_TILES was set at compile time (MSDOS protected mode only):
preload_tiles  control whether tiles get pre-loaded into RAM at the
               start of the game.  Doing so enhances performance
               of the tile graphics, but uses more memory.        [TRUE]

Any Boolean option can be negated by prefixing it with a '!' or 'no'.


Compound options are written as option_name:option_value.

Compound options which can be set during the game are:

boulder       override the default boulder symbol with another default: [`]
disclose      the types of information you want offered at the end of the
              game  [ni na nv ng nc no]
fruit         the name of a fruit you enjoy eating  [slime mold]
              (basically a whimsy which NetHack uses from time to time).
menustyle     user interface for selection of multiple objects:
              Traditional -- prompt for classes of interest, then
                             prompt item-by-item for those classes;
              Combination -- prompt for classes of interest, then
                             use a menu for choosing items;
              Full        -- menu for classes of interest, then item menu;
              Partial     -- skip class filtering, use menu of all items;
              only the first letter ('T','C','P','F') matters; 'N' (None)
              is a synonym for 'T', as is boolean style negation  [Full]
number_pad    alphabetic versus numeric control over movement:
               0 -- traditional hjkl + yubn movement (default);
               1 -- digits control movement, for use with numeric keypad;
               2 -- same as 1, but '5' works as 'g' prefix rather than 'G';
               3 -- numeric for phone keypad (1,2,3 above, 7,8,9 below);
               4 -- phone keypad (3) combined with MSDOS compatibility (2);
              -1 -- alphabetic movement but 'z' swapped with 'y'.  [0]
packorder     a list of default symbols for kinds of objects that gives the
              order in which your pack will be displayed  [")[%?+!=/(*`0_]
              (If you specify only some kinds of items, the others from the
              default order will be appended to the end.)
paranoid_confirmation  space separated list of situations where alternate
              prompting is desired  [paranoid_confirmation:pray]
              Confirm -- when requiring yes, also require no to reject
              quit    -- yes vs y to confirm quitting or to enter explore mode
              die     -- yes vs y to confirm dying (for explore or debug mode)
              bones   -- yes vs y to confirm saving bones data in debug mode
              attack  -- yes vs y to confirm attacking a peaceful monster
              pray    -- y to confirm an attempt to pray; on by default
              Remove  -- always pick from inventory for 'R' and 'T' even when
              wearing just one applicable item to remove or take off
pickup_burden when you pick up an item that exceeds this encumberance
              level (Unencumbered, Burdened, streSsed, straiNed, overTaxed,
              or overLoaded), you will be asked if you want to continue. [S]
pickup_types  a list of default symbols for kinds of objects to autopickup
              when that option is on  [all]
pile_limit    for feedback when walking across floor objects, threshold at
              which "there are many objects here" is displayed instead of
              listing the objects.  (0 means "always list objects.")  [5]
runmode       controls how often the map window is updated when performing
              multi-step movement (various running modes or travel command):
              teleport -- don't update map until movement stops;
              run      -- periodically update map (interval is seven steps);
              walk     -- update map after every step;
              crawl    -- like walk, but delay after making each step.
              (This only affects screen display, not actual movement.)  [run]
scores        the parts of the score list you wish to see when the game ends
              You choose a combination of top scores, scores around the top
              scores, and all of your own scores.  [!own/3 top/2 around]
suppress_alert disable various version-specific warnings about changes
              in game play or the user interface, such as notification given
              for the 'Q' command that quitting is now done via #quit
              (e.g., use suppress_alert:3.3.1 to stop that and any other
              notifications added in that version or earlier) default: [(none)]

Compound options which may be set only on startup are:

align      Your starting alignment (align:lawful, align:neutral,
           or align:chaotic).  You may specify just the first letter.  [RANDOM]
catname    the name of your first cat  [NONE]
dogname    the name of your first dog  [NONE]
dungeon    a list of symbols to be used in place of the default ones for
           drawing the dungeon.
           The symbols are subjected to a fair amount of processing, so
           that you can use C-style escapes such as \n or \081 as well as
           indicate control characters by ^x or meta characters by \Mx.
           As usual, \ can force the next character to be taken literally.
           Since many of the default symbols are overloaded, they are
           given here by name instead of symbol, with some added notes:
           stone                               (solid rock, normally ' ')
           vwall hwall tlcorn trcorn blcorn brcorn      (room boundaries)

           boomleft boomright                                (boomerangs)
           ss1 ss2 ss3 ss4                           (shielding sequence)

           extl extm extr                      (explosion matrix top row)
           exml exmm exmr                   (explosion matrix middle row)
           exbl exbm exbr                   (explosion matrix bottom row)
           default:  |-\\/*!)(0#@*/-\\||\\-//-\\|\ |\\-/
gender     Your starting gender (gender:male or gender:female).
           You may specify just the first letter.  Although you can
           still denote your gender using the "male" and "female"
           options, the "gender" option will take precedence.  [RANDOM]
horsename  the name of your first horse  [NONE]
menu_*     create single character accelerators for menu commands.  Below
           is a list of all commands.  Each is followed by a list of window-
           ports that implement them:  'x' is X11, 't' is tty, 'g' is Gem,
           'a' is Amiga.

           choose only the first role it finds that matches; thus, it
           is recommended that you spell out as much of the role name
           as possible.  You can also still denote your role by
           appending it to the "name" option (e.g., name:Vic-V), but the
           "role" option will take precedence.  [RANDOM]
traps      like dungeon, but for trap symbols
           arrow_trap dart_trap falling_rock_trap squeaky_board

%title The Colour of Magic  (2)
%passage 1
It has been remarked before that those who are sensitive to radiation in
the far octarine - the eighth colour, the pigment of the Imagination - can
see things that others cannot.

Thus it was that Rincewind, hurrying through the crowded, flare-lit,
evening bazarrs of Morpork with the Luggage trundling behind him, jostled a
tall figure, turned to deliver a few suitable curses, and beheld Death.

It had to be Death.  No-one else went around with empty eye sockets and, of
course, the scythe over one shoulder was another clue.

  [The Colour of Magic, by Terry Pratchett]
%e passage 1
%passage 2
As he was drawn towards the Eye the terror-struck Rincewind raised the box
protectively, and at the same time heard the picture imp say, 'They're
about ripe now, can't hold them any longer.  Every-one smile, please.'

There was a -
- flash of light so white and so bright - 
- it didn't seem like light at all.

Bel-Shamharoth screamed, a sound that started in the far ultrasonic and
finished somewhere in Rincewind's bowels.  The tentacles went momentarily
as stiff as rods, hurling their various cargos around the room, before
bunching up protectively in front of the abused Eye.  The whole mass
dropped into the pit and a moment later the big slab was snatched up by
several dozen tentacles and slammed into place, leaving a number of
thrashing limbs trapped around the edge.

'Cohen is my name, boy' Belthan's hands stopped moving.
'Cohen?' she said, 'Cohen the Barbarian?'
'The very shame.'
'Hang on, hang on,' said Rincewind, 'Cohen's a great big chap, neck like a
bull, got chest muscles like a sack of footballs.  I mean, he's the Disc's
greatest warrior, a legend in his own lifetime.  I remember my grandad
telling me he saw him ... my grandad telling me he ... my grandad ...'
He faltered under the gimlit gaze.
'Oh,' he said, 'Oh. Of course, Sorry.'
'Yesh,' said Cohen, and sighed, 'Thatsh right boy, I'm a lifetime in my own
legend.'

%e passage 1
%passage 2
Death sat at one side of a black baize table in the entre of the room,
arguing with Famine, War and Pestilence.  Twoflower was the only one to
look up and notice Rincewind.
'Hey, how did you get here?' he said.
'Well, some say that the creator took a handful - oh, I see, well, it's
hard to explain but I -'
'Have you got the Luggage?'
The wooden box pushed past Rincewind and settled down in front of its
owner, who opened its lid and rummaged around inside until he came up with
a small, leatherbound book which he handed to War, who was hammering the
table with a mailed fist.
'It's "Nosehinger on the Laws of Contract",' he said. 'It's quite good,
there's a lot in it about double finessing and how to -'
Death snatched the book with a bony hand and flipped through the pages, 
quite oblivious to the presence of the two men.
'RIGHT,' he said, 'PESTILENCE, OPEN ANOTHER PACK OF CARDS. I'M GOING TO GET
TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS IF IT KILLS ME. FIGURATIVELY SPEAKING OF COURSE.'

Million-to-one chances...crop up nine times out of ten.

  [Equal Rites, by Terry Pratchett]
%e passage
%passage 3
Animal minds are simple, and therefore sharp. Animals never spend time
dividing experience into little bits and speculating about all the bits 
they've missed. The whole panoply of the universe has been neatly 
expressed to them as things to (a) mate with, (b) eat, (c) run away from, 
and (d) rocks. This frees the mind from unnecessary thoughts and gives 
it a cutting edge where it matters. Your normal animal, in fact, never
tries to walk and chew gum at the same time. 

The average human, on the other hand, thinks about all sorts of things 
around the clock, on all sorts of levels, with interruptions from dozens
of biological calendars and timepieces. There's thoughts about to be said,
and private thoughts, and real thoughts, and thoughts about thoughts, and 
a whole gamut of subconscious thoughts. To a telepath the human head is 
a din. It is a railway terminus with all the Tannoys talking at once. 
It is a complete FM waveband- and some of those stations aren't reputable,
they're outlawed pirates on forbidden seas who play late-night records with
limbic lyrics.

%passage 2
#submitted by Boudewijn
Verence tried to avoid walking through walls. A man had his dignity.
He became aware that he was being watched.
He turned his head.
There was a cat sitting in the doorway, subjecting him to a slow blink.
It was a mottled grey and extremely fat...
No. It was extremely /big/. It was covered with so much scar tissue 
that it looked like a fist with fur on it. Its ears were a couple of
perforated stubs, its eyes two yellow slits of easy-going malevolence,
its tail a twitching series of question marks as it stared at him.
Greebo had heard that Lady Felmet had a small white female cat and had
strolled up to pay his respects. Verence had never seen an animal with
so much built-in villainy. He didn't resist as it waddled across the
floor and dried to rub itself against his legs, purring like a 
waterfall.

'Well, well,' said the king, vaguely. He reached down and made an 
effort to scratch it behind the two ragged bits on top of its head. 
It was a relief to find someone else besides another ghost who could 
see him, and Greebo, he couldn't help feeling, was a distinctly unusual
cat. Most of the castle cats were either pampered pets or flat-eared 
kitchen and stable habitues who generally resembled the very rodents
they lived on. This cat, on the other hand, was its own animal. All 
cats give that impression, of course, but instead of the mindless 
animal self-absorption that passes for secret wisdom in the creatures, 
Greebo radiated genuime intelligence. He also radiated a smell that 
would have knocked over a wall and caused sinus trouble in a dead fox.

%passage 1
No enemies had ever taken Ankh-Morpork. Well, /technically/ they had, quite
 often; the city welcomed free-spending barbarian invaders, but somehow the
 puzzled raiders always found, after a few days, that they didn't own their
 own horses any more, and within a couple of months they were just another
minority group with its own graffiti and food shops.

Rincewind looked down at the broad steps they were climbing. They were
 something of a novelty; each one was built out of large stone letters. The
 one he was just stepping on to, for example, read: I Meant It For The Best.
The next one was: I Thought You'd Like It.
Eric was standing on: For The Sake Of The Children.
'Weird, isn't it?' he said. 'Why do it like this?'
'I think they're meant to be good intentions,' said Rincewind. This was a
road to hell, and demons were, after all, traditionalists.

 been a trick of an echo, or something. It wasn't that the dog had gone
 'woof!', although that was practically unique in itself; most dogs in the
 universe /never/ went 'woof!', they had complicated barks like 'whuuugh!'
 and 'hwhoouf!'. No, it was that it hadn't in fact /barked/ at all. It had

%passage 3
So history has its caretakers.

They live ... well, in the nature of things they live wherever they are
sent, but their /spiritual/ home is in a hidden valley in the high Ramtops
of the Discworld, where the books of history are kept.

These aren't books in which the events of the past are pinned like so many
butterflies to a cork.  These are the books from which history in derived.
There are more than twenty thousand of them, each one is ten feet high,
bound in lead, and the letters are so small that they have to be read with
a magnifying glass.

When people say "It is written ..." it is written /here/.

There are fewer metaphors than people think.

Every month the abbot and two senior monks go into the cave where the
books are kept.  It used to be the duty of the abbot alone, but two other
reliable monks were included after the unfortunate case of the 59th Abbot,
who made a million dollars in small bets before his fellow monks caught up
with him.

Besides, it's dangerous to go in alone.  The sheer concentratedness of
History, sleeting past soundlessly out into the world, can be overwhelming.
Time is a drug.  Too much of it kills you.

It was the Year of the Notional Serpent, or two hundred years after the
Declaration of the Prophet Abbys.

Which meant that the time of the 8th Prophet was imminent.

That was the reliable thing about the Church of the Great God Om.  It had
very punctual prophets.  You could set your calendar by them, if you had
one big enough.

And, as is generally the case around the time a prophet is expected, the
Church redoubled its efforts to be holy.  This was very much like the
bustle you get in any large concern when the auditors are expected, but
tended towards taking people suspected of being less holy and putting them
to death in a hundred ingenious ways.  This is considered a reliable
barometer of the state of one's piety in most of the really popular
religions.  There's a tendency to declare that there is more backsliding
around than in the national toboggan championships, that heresy must be
torn out root and branch, and even arm and leg and eye and tongue, and
that it's time to wipe the slate clean.  Blood is generally considered
very efficient for this purpose.

There were all sorts of ways to petition the Great God, but they depended

in the world clearly had done it with the approval of the Great God,
because it was impossible to believe that they had managed it with His
/disapproval/.  In the same way, the Quisition could act without
possibility of flaw.  Suspicion was proof.  How could it be anything else?
The Great God would not have seen fit to put the suspicion in the minds
of His exquisitors unless it was /right/ that it should be there.  Life
could be very simple, if you believed in the Great God Om.  And sometimes
quite short, too.

All over the world there were rulers with titles like the Exalted, the

the ruler elected by the people, who could remove him whenever they
wanted--and they called him the Tyrant.

The Ephebians believed that every man should have the vote.(1)  Every five
years someone was elected to be Tyrant, provided he could prove that he
was honest, intelligent, sensible, and trustworthy.  Immediately after he
was elected, of course, it was obvious to everyone that he was a criminal
madman and totally out of touch with the view of the ordinary philosopher
in the street looking for a towel.  And then five years later they elected
another one just like him, and really it was amazing how intelligent

It was very hard, being a reader in Invisible Writings.(1)

(1) The study of invisible writings was a new discipline made available by
the discovery of the bi-directional nature of Library-Space.  The thaumic
mathematics are complex, but boil down to the fact that all books,
everywhere, affect all other books.  This is obvious:  books inspire
other books written in the future, and cite books written in the past.
But the General Theory(2) of L-Space suggests that, in that case, the
contents of books /as yet unwritten/ can be deduced from books now in
existence.

What is magic?

There is the wizards' explanation, which comes in two forms, depending on
the age of the wizard.  Older wizards talk about candles, circles, planets,
stars, bananas, chants, runes, and the importance of having at least four
good meals every day.  Younger wizards, particularly the pale ones who
spend most of their time in the High Energy Magic building,(1) chatter at
length about fluxes in the morphic nature of the universe, the essentially
impermanent quality of even the most apparently rigid time-space framework,
the impossibility of reality, and so on:  what this means is that they have

What is magic?

Then there is the witches' explanation, which comes in two forms, depending
on the age of the witch.  Older witches hardly put words to it at all, but
may suspect in their hearts that the universe really doesn't know what the
hell is going on and consists of a zillion trillion billion possibilities,
and could become any of them if a trained mind rigid with quantum certainty
was inserted in the crack and /twisted/; that, if you really had to make
someone's hat explode, all you needed to do was /twist/ into the universe
where a large number of hat molecules all decide at the same time to bounce
off in different directions.

Younger witches, on the other hand, talk about it all the time and believe
it involves crystals, mystic forces, and dancing about without yer drawers
on.

Everyone may to right, all at the same time.  That's the thing about
quantum.

There were such things as dwarf gods.  Dwarfs were not a naturally

%passage 7
"Oh, my," said Detritus.  "I think this the pork futures warehouse in
Morpork Road."

"What?"

"Used to work here," said the troll.  "Used to work everywhere.  Go away,
you stupid troll, you too thick," he added, gloomily.

"Is there any way out?"

"The main door is in Morpork Street.  But no one comes in here for months.
Till pork exists."(1)

Cuddy shivered.

(1) Probably no other world in the multiverse has warehouses for things
which only exist /in potentia/, but the pork futures warehouse in Ankh-
Morpork is a product of the Patrician's rules about baseless metaphors,
the literal-mindedness of citizens who assume that everything must
exist somewhere, and the general thinness of the fabric of reality
around Ankh, which is so thin that it's as thin as a very thin thing.
The net result is that trading in pork futures--in pork /that doesn't
exist yet/--led to the building of the warehouse to store it until it
does.  The extremely low temperatures are caused by the imbalance in
the temporal energy flow.  At least, that's what the wizards in the
High Energy Magic building say.  And they've got proper pointy hats and
letters after their name, so they know what they're talking about.

accident, but if not then any criminal would do, and since everyone was

The Library didn't only contain magical books, the ones which are chained
to their shelves and are very dangerous.  It also contained perfectly
ordinary books, printed on commonplace paper in mundane ink.  It would be
a mistake to think that they weren't also dangerous, just because reading
them didn't make fireworks go off in the sky.  Reading them sometimes did
the more dangerous trick of making fireworks go off in the privacy of the
reader's brain.

For example, the big volume open in front of him contained some of the
collected drawings of Leonard of Quirm, skilled artist and certified
genious, with a mind that wandered so much it came back with souvenirs.

Leonard's books were full of sketches--of kittens, of the way water flows,
of the wives of influential Ankh-Morporkian merchants whose portraits had
provided his means of making a living.  But Leonard had been a genius and
was deeply sensitive to the wonders of the world, so the margins were full
of detailed doodles of whatever was on this mind at the moment--vast
water-powered engines for bringing down city walls on the heads of the
enemy, new types of siege guns for pumping flaming oil over the enemy,
gunpowder rockets that showered the enemy with burning phosphorous, and
other manufactures of the Age of Reason.

Some religions say that the universe was started with a word, a song,

trained their hearing until they can tell the value of a playing card by

subtle sounds of the universe to piece together, from the fossile echoes,
the very first noises.

There was certainly, they say, a very strange noise at the beginning of
everything.

But the keenest ears (the ones who win most at poker), who listen to the
frozen echoes in the ammonites and amber, swear they can detect some tiny
sounds before that.

It sounded, they say, like someone counting:  One, Two, Three, Four.

The very best one, who listened to basalt, said he thought he could make

The Death of Rats put his nose in his paws.  It was a lot easier with

before the Patrician came to power there was a terrible plague of rats.
The city council countered it by offering twenty pence for every rat
tail.  This did, for a week or two, reduce the number of rats--and then
people were suddenly queueing up with tails, the city treasury was being
drained, and no one seemed to be doing much work.  And there /still/
seemed to be a lot of rats around.  Lord Vetinari had listened carefully
while the problem was explained, and had solved the thing with one

offers, and about the natural instinct of Ankh-Morporkians in any

Many things went on at Unseen University and, regretably, teaching had to
be one of them.  The faculty had long ago confronted this fact and had
perfected various devices for avoiding it.  But this was perfectly all
right because, to be fair, so had the students.

The system worked quite well and, as happens in such cases, had taken on
the status of a tradition.  Lectures clearly took place, because they
were down there on the timetable in black and white.  The fact that no one
attended was an irrelevant detail.  It was occasionally maintained that
this meant that the lectures did not in fact happen at all, but no one ever
attended them to find out if this was true.  Anyway, it was argued (by the
Reader in Woolly Thinking(1)) that lectures had taken place /in essence/,
so that was all right, too.

And therefore education at the University mostly worked by the age-old
method of putting a lot of young people in the vicinty of a lot of books
and hoping that something would pass from one to the other, while the
actual young people put themselves in the vicinity of inns and taverns
for exactly the same reason.

'Maybe you could ... help us?'

'What's wrong?'

'It's my boy ...'

Granny opened the door farther and saw the woman standing behind Mr. Slot.
One look at her face was enough.  There was a bundle in her arms.

Granny stepped back.  'Bring him in and let me have a look at him.'

She took the baby from the woman, sat down on the room's one chair, and
pulled back the blanket.  Nanny Ogg peered over her shoulder.

'Hmm,' said Granny, after a while.  She glanced at Nanny, who gave an
almost imperceptible shake of her head.

'There's a curse on this house, that's what it is,' said Slot.  'My best
cow's been taken mortally sick, too.'

'Oh?  You have a cowshed?' said Granny.  'Very good place for a sickroom,
a cowshed.  It's the warmth.  You better show me where it is.'

'You want to take the boy down there?'

'Right now.'

  [...]

'How many have you come for?'

ONE.

'The cow?'

Death shook his head.

'It could /be/ the cow.'

NO.  THAT WOULD BE CHANGING HISTORY.

'History is about things changing.'

NO.

Granny sat back.

'Then I challenge you to a game.  That's traditional.  That's /allowed/.'

Death was silent for a moment.

THIS IS TRUE.

'Good.'

CHALLENGING ME BY MEANS OF A GAME IS ALLOWABLE.

"Yes."

HOWEVER ... YOU UNDERSTAND THAT TO WIN ALL YOU MUST GAMBLE ALL?

'Double or quits?  Yes, I know.'

BUT NOT CHESS.

'Can't abide chess.'

OR CRIPPLE MR. ONION.  I'VE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO UNDERSTAND THE RULES.

'Very well.  How about one hand of poker?  Five cards each, no draws?
Sudden death, as they say.'

Death thought about this, too.

YOU KNOW THIS FAMILY?

'No.'

THEN WHY?

'Are we talking or are we playing?'

OH, VERY WELL.

  [...]

Granny looked at her cards, and threw them down.

FOUR QUEENS.  HMM.  THAT /IS/ VERY HIGH.

Death looked down at his cards, and then up into Granny's steady, blue-eyed
gaze.

Neither moved for some time.

Then Death laid the hand on the table.

I LOSE, he said.  ALL I HAVE IS FOUR ONES.

He looked back into Granny's eyes for a moment.  There was a blue glow in
the depth of his eye-sockets.  Maybe, for the merest fraction of a second,
barely noticeable even to the closest observation, one winked off.

Agnes had woken up one morning with the horrible realization that she'd
been saddled with a lovely personality.  It was as simple as that.  Oh,
and very good hair.

It wasn't so much the personality, it was the "but" people always added
when they talked about it.  /But she's got a lovely personality/, they
said.  It was the lack of choice that rankled.  No one had asked her,
before she was born, whether she wanted a lovely personality or whether
she'd prefer, say, a miserable personality but a body that could take
size nine in dresses.  Instead, people would take pains to tell her that
beauty was only skin-deep, as if a man ever fell for an attractive pair

Lancre had always bred strong, capable women.  A Lancre farmer needed a
wife who'd think nothing of beating a wolf to death with her apron when
she went out to get some firewood.  And, while kissing initially seemed to
have more charms than cookery, a stolid Lancre lad looking for a bride
would bear in mind his father's advice that kisses eventually lost their
fire but cookery tended to get even better over the years, and direct his
courting to those families that clearly showed a tradition of enjoying
their food.

She'd caught herself saying "poot!" and "dang!" when she wanted to swear,
and using pink writing paper.

She'd got a reputation for being calm and capable in a crisis.

Next thing she knew she'd be making shortbread and apple pies as good as
her mother's, and then there'd be no hope for her.

So she'd introduced Perdita.  She'd heard somewhere that inside every fat
woman was a thin woman trying to get out,(1) so she'd named her Perdita.
She was a good repository for all those thoughts that Agnes couldn't think
on account of her wonderful personality.  Perdita would use black writing
paper if she could get away with it, and would be beautifully pale instead
of embarassingly flushed.  Perdita wanted to be an interestingly lost soul
in plum-colored lipstick.  Just occasionally, though, Agnes thought
Perdita was as dumb as she was.

She looked down at the money in her hand.

She knew about old money, which was somehow hallowed by the fact that
people had hung on to it for years, and she knew about new money, which
seemed to be being made by all these upstarts that were flooding into the
city these days.  But under her powdered bosom she was an Ankh-Morpork
shopkeeper, and knew that the best kind of money was the sort that was in
her hand rather than someone else's.  The best kind of money was mine,
not yours.

Besides, she was also enough of a snob to confuse rudeness with good
breeding.  In the same way that the really rich can never be mad (they're
eccentric), so they can also never be rude (they're outspoken and
forthright).

Upstairs, Vimes pushed open his office door carefully.  The Assassins'

terribly bad form to kill a bystander.  Apart from anything else, you
wouldn't get paid.  So traps in his office were out of the question,
because too many people were in and out of it every day.  Even so, it
paid to be careful.  Vimes /was/ good at making the kind of rich enemies

Everyone in the city looked after themselves.  That's what the guilds were
for.  People banded together against other people.  The guild looked after
you from the cradle to the grave or, in the case of the Assassins, to
other people's graves.  They even maintained the law, or at least they had
done, after a fashion.  Thieving without a license was punishable by death
for the first offense.(1)  The Thieves' Guild saw to that.  The arrangement
sounded unreal, but it worked.

It worked like a machine.  That was fine except for the occasional people
who got caught in the wheels.

Vimes struggled to his feet, shook his head, and set off after it.  No

policemen to chase anything that runs away.

Vimes pounded through the fog after the fleeing figure.  It wasn't quite
so fast as him, despite the twinges in his legs and one or two warning
stabs from his left knee, but whenever he came close to it some muffled
pedestrian got in the way, or a cart pulled out from a cross street.(1)

(1) This always happens in any police chase /anywhere/.  A heavily laden
lorry will /always/ pull out of a side alley in front of the pursuit.  If

Samuel Vimes dreamed about Clues.

He had a jaundiced view of Clues.  He instinctively distrusted them.  They
got in the way.

And he distrusted the kind of person who'd take one look at another man
and say in a lordly voice to his companion, "Ah, my dear sir.  I can tell
you nothing except that he is a left-handed stonemason who has spent some
years in the merchant navy and has recently fallen on hard times," and
then unroll a lot of supercilious commentary about calluses and stance
and the state of a man's boots, when /exactly the same/ comments could
apply to a man who was wearing his old clothes because he'd been doing a
spot of home bricklaying for a new barbecue pit, and had been tatooed
once when he was drunk and seventeen(1) and in fact got seasick on a wet
pavement.  What arrogance!  What an insult to the rich and chaotic variety
of the human experience.

It was the same with more static evidence.  The footprints in the
flowerbed were probably /in the real world/ left by the window-cleaner.
The scream in the night was quite likely a man getting out of bed and
stepping sharply on an upturned hairbrush.

The real world was far too /real/ to leave neat little hints.  It was full
of too many things.  It wasn't by eliminating the impossible that you got
at the truth, however improbable; it was by the much harder process of
eliminating the possibilities.  You worked away, patiently asking questions
and looking hard at things.  You walked and talked, and in your heart you
just hoped like hell that some bugger's nerve'd crack and he'd give himself
up.

Everything starts somewhere, though many physicists disagree.

But people have always been dimly aware of the problem with the start of
things.  They wonder how the snowplow driver gets to work, or how the
makers of dictionaries look up the spelling of words.  Yet there is the
constant desire to find some point in the twisting, knotting, raveling
nets of space-time on which a metaphorical finger can be put to indicate
that here, /here/, is the point where it all began ...

/Something/ began when the Guild of Assassins enrolled Mister Teatime,
who saw things differently from other people, and one of the ways that
he saw things differently from other people was in seeing other people
as things (later, Lord Downey of the Guild said, "We took pity on him
because he'd lost both parents at an early age.  I think that, on
reflection, we should have wondered a bit more about that.")

If asked to describe what they did for a living, the five men around the
table would have said something like "This and that" or "The best I can,"
although in Banjo's case he'd probably have said "Dur?"  They were, by the
standards of an uncaring society, criminals, although they wouldn't have
thought of themselves as such and couldn't even /spell/ words like
"nefarious."  What they generally did was move things around.  Sometimes
the things were on the wrong side of a steel door, or in the wrong house.
Sometimes the things were in fact people who were far too unimportant to
trouble the Assassins' Guild with, but who were nevertheless inconveniently
positioned where they were and would be much better located on, for
example, a sea bed somewhere.(1)  None of the five belonged to any formal
guild and they generally found their clients among those people who, for
their own dark reasons, didn't want to put the guilds to any trouble,
sometimes because they were guild members themselves.  They had plenty of
work.  There was always something that needed transferring from A to B or,
of course, to the bottom of the C.

(1) Chickenwire had got his name from his own individual contribution to
the science of this very specialized "concrete overshoe" form of waste
disposal.  An unfortunate drawback of the process was the tendency for
bits of the client to eventually detach and float to the surface, causing
much comment among the general poplation.  Enough chicken wire, he pointed
out, would solve that, while also allowing the ingress of crabs and fish
going about their vital recycling activities.

Although it was Hogswatch the University buildings were bustling.  Wizards
didn't go to bed early in any case,(1) and of course there was the
Hogswatchnight Feast to look forward to at midnight.

It would give some idea of the scale of the Hogswatchnight Feast that a
light snack at UU consisted of three or four courses, not counting the
cheese and nuts.

Some of the wizards had been practicing for weeks.  The Dean in particular
could now lift a twenty-pound turkey on one fork.  Having to wait until
midnight merely put a healthy edge on appetites already professionally
honed.

(1) Often they lived to a time scale to suit themselves.  Many of the
senior ones, of course, lived entirely in the past, but several were like
the Professor of Anthropics, who had invented an entire temporal system
based on the belief that all the other ones were a mere illusion.

Many people are aware of the Weak and Strong Anthropic Principles.  The
Weak One says, basically, that it was jolly amazing of the universe to be
constructed in such a way that humans could evolve to a point where they
could make a living in, for example, universities, while the Strong One
says that, on the contrary, the whole point of the universe was that
humans should not only work in universities, but also write for huge sums
books with words like "Cosmic" and "Chaos" in the titles.(2)

The UU Professor of Anthropics had developed the Special and Inevitable
Anthropic Principle, which was that the entire reason for the existence of
the universe was the eventual evolution of the UU Professor of Anthropics.
But this was only a formal statement of the theory which absolutely
everyone, with only some minor details of a "Fill in name here" nature,
secretly believes to be true.

(2) And they are correct.  The universe clearly operates for the benefit
of humanity.  This can be readily seen by the convenient way the sun comes
up in the morning, when people are ready to start the day.

"So mistletoe, in fact, symbolizes mistletoe?"

"Exactly, Archchancellor," said the Senior Wrangler, who was now just

What Ponder was worried about was the fear that he was simply engaged in a
cargo cult.  He'd read about them.  Ignorant(1) and credulous(2) people,
whose island might once have been visited by some itinerant merchant
vessel that traded pearls and coconuts for such fruits of civilization as
glass beads, mirrors, axes, and sexual diseases, would later make big model
ships out of bamboo in the hope of once again attracting this magical
cargo.  Of course, they were far too ignorant and credulous to know that
just because you built the shape you didn't get the substance ...

(1) Ignorant:  the state of not knowing what a pronoun is, or how to find
the square root of 27.4, and merely knowing childish and useless things
like which of the seventy almost identical-looking species of the purple
sea snake are the deadly ones, how to treat the poisonous pith of the
Sago-sago tree to make a nourishing gruel, how to foretell the weather by
the movements of the tree-climbing Burglar Crab, how to navigate across
a thousand miles of featureless ocean by means of a piece of string and a
small clay model of your grandfather, how to get essential vitamins from
the liver of the ferocious Ice Bear, and other such trivial matters.  It's
a strange thing that when everyone becomes educated, everyone knows about
the pronoun but no one knows about the Sago-sago.

(2) Credulous:  having views about the world, the universe and humanity's
place in it that are shared only by very unsophisticated people and the
most intelligent and advanced mathematicians and physicists.

It was so much easier to blame it on Them.  It was bleakly depressing to
think that They were Us.  If it was Them, then nothing was anyone's fault.
If it was us, what did that make Me?  After all, I'm one of Us.  I must be.
I've certainly never thought of myself as one of Them.  No one ever thinks
of themselves as one of Them.  We're always one of Us.  It's Them that do
the bad things.

There was a general shifting of position and a group clearing of throats.

'What about mercenaries?' said Boggis.

'The problem with mercenaries', said the Patrician, 'is that they need to
be paid to start fighting.  And, unless you are very lucky, you end up
paying them even more to stop--'

Selachii thumped the table.

'Very well, then, by jingo!' he snarled.  'Alone!'

'We could certainly do with one,' said Lord Vetinari.  'We need the money.
I was about to say that we cannot /afford/ mercenaries.'

'How can this be?' said Lord Downey.  Don't we pay our taxes?'

'Ah, I thought we might come to that,' said Lord Vetinari.  He raised
his hand and, on cue again, his clerk placed a piece of paper in it.

'Let me see now ... ah yes.  Guild of Assassins ...  Gross earnings in
the last year: AM$13,207,048.  Taxes paid in the last year: forty-seven
dollars, twenty-two pence and what on examination turned out to be a
Hershebian half-/dong/, worth one eighth of a penny.'

'That's all perfectly legal!  The Guild of Accountants--'

'Ah yes.  Guild of Accountants: gross earnings AM$7,999,011.  Taxes paid:
nil.  But, ah yes, I see they applied for a rebate of AM$200,000.'

'And what we received, I may say, included a Hershebian half-/dong/,'
said Mr Frostrip of the Guild of Accountants.

'What goes around comes around,' said Vetinari calmly.

He tossed the paper aside.  'Taxation, gentlemen, is very much like dairy
farming.  The task is to extract the maximum amount of milk with the
minimum of moo.  And I am afraid to say that these days all I get is moo.'

'Are you telling us that Ankh-Morpork is /bankrupt/?' said Downey.

'Of course.  While, at the same time, full of rich people.  I trust they
have been spending their good fortune on swords.'

'And you have /allowed/ this wholesale tax avoidance?' said Lord Selachii.

'Oh, the taxes haven't been avoided,' said Lord Vetinari.  'Or even evaded.
They just haven't been paid.'

'That is a disgusting state of affairs!'

The Patrician raised his eyebrows. 'Commander Vines?'

'Yes, sir?'

'Would you be so good as to assemble a squad of your most experienced men,
liaise with the tax gatherers and obtain the accumulated back taxes,
please?  My clerk here will give you a list of the prime defaulters.'

'Right, sir.  And if they resist, sir?' said Vimes, smiling nastily.

'Oh, how can they resist, commander?  This is the will of our civic
leaders.'  He took the paper his clerk proferred.  'Let me see, now.  Top
of the list--'

Lord Selachii coughed hurriedly.  'Far too late for that sort of nonsense
now,' he said.

'Water under the bridge,' said Lord Downey.

'Dead and buried,' said Mr Slant.

'I paid mine,' said Vimes.

Perhaps it was because he was tired, or just because he was trying to shut
out the world, but Vimes found himself slowing down into the traditional
Watchman's walk and the traditional idling thought process.

It was an almost Pavlovian response.(1)  The legs swung, the feet moved,
the mind began to work in a certain way.  It wasn't a dream state, exactly.
It was just that the ears, nose and eyeballs wired themselves straight into
the ancient "suspicious bastard" node of his brain, leaving his higher
brain center free to freewheel.

(1) A term invented by the wizard Denephew Boot,(2) who had found that by
a system of rewards and punishments he could train a dog, at the ringing

They were expecting to call her Denise.

"What was it, Leonard?"

"An experimental device for turning chemical energy into rotary motion,"
said Leonard.  "The problem, you see, is getting the little pellets of
black powder into the combustion chamber at exactly the right speed and
one at a time.  If two ignite together, well, what he have is the
/external/ combustion engine."

"And, er, what would be the purpose of it?" said the Patrician.

"I believe it could replace the horse," Leonard said proudly.

They looked at the stricken thing.

"One of the advantages of horses that people often point out," said
Vetinari, after some thought, "is that they very seldom explode.  Almost
never, in my experience, apart from that unfortunate occurrence in the hot
summer a few years ago."  With fastidious fingers he pulled something out
of the mess.  It was a pair of cubes, made out of some soft white fur and
linked together by a piece of string.  There were dots on them.

"Dice?" he said.

Leonard smiled in an embarrassed fashion.  "Yes.  I can't think why I
thought they'd help it go better.  It was just, well, an idea.  You know
how it is."

He was as easily distracted as a kitten.  All that business with the
flying machine, for example.  Giant bat wings hung from the ceiling even
now.  The Patrician had been more than happy to let him waste his time on
that idea, because it was obvious to anyone that no human being would ever
be able to flap the wings hard enough.

He needn't have worried.  Leonard was his own distraction.  He had ended
up spending ages designing a special tray so that people could eat their
meals in the air.

She held the lamp higher.

Ramkins looked down their noses at her from their frames, through the brown
varnish of the centuries.  Portraits were another thing that had been
collected out of unregarded habit.

Most of them were men.  They were invariably in armor and always on
horseback.  And every single one of them had fought the sworn enemies of
Ankh-Morpork.

In recent times this had been quite difficult and her grandfather, for
example, had to lead an expedition all the way to Howondaland in order to
find some sworn enemies, although there was an adequate supply and a lot
of swearing by the time he left.  Earlier, of course, it had been a lot
easier.  Ramkin regiments had fought the city's enemies all over the Sto
Plains and had inflicted heroic casualties, quite often on people in the
opposing armies.(1)

(1) It is a long-cherished tradition among a certain type of military
thinker that huge casualties are the main thing.  If they are on the other

He rummaged in a pocket and produced a very small book, which he held up
for inspection.

"This belonged to my great-grandad," he said.  "He was in the scrap we had

soldiers, 'cos you need all the prayers you can get, believe you me, and
he stuck it in the top pocket of his jerkin, 'cause he couldn't afford
armor, and next day in battle--whoosh, this arrow came out of nowhere, wham,
straight into this book and it went all the way through to the last page
before stopping, look.  You can see the hole."

"Pretty miraculous," Carrot agreed.

Death had taken to keeping Rincewind's lifetimer on a special shelf in his
study, in much the way that a zoologist would want to keep an eye on a
particularly intriguing specimen.

The lifetimers of most people were the classic shape that Death thought
was right and proper for the task.  They appeared to be large eggtimers,
although, since the sands they measured were the living seconds of
someone's life, all the eggs were in one basket.

Rincewind's hourglass looked like something created by a glassblower who'd
had hiccups in a time machine.  According to the amount of actual sand it
contained--and Death was pretty good at making this kind of estimate--he
should have died long ago.  But strange curves and bends and extrusions of
glass had developed over the years, and quite often the sand was flowing
backwards, or diagonally.  Clearly, Rincewind had been hit by so much
magic, had been thrust reluctantly through time and space so often that
he'd nearly bumped into himself coming the other way, that the precise end
of his life was now as hard to find as the starting point on a roll of
really sticky transparent tape.

Death was familiar with the concept of the eternal, ever-renewed hero, the
champion with a thousand faces.  He'd refrained from commenting.  He met
heroes frequently, generally surrounded by, and this was important, the
dead bodies of /very nearly/ all of their enemies and saying, "Vot the hell
shust happened?"  Whether there was some arrangement that allowed them to
come back again afterwards was not something he would be drawn on.

But he pondered whether, if this creature /did/ exist, it was somehow
balanced by the eternal coward.  The hero with a thousand retreating backs,
perhaps.  Many cultures had a legend of an undying hero who would one day
rise again, so perhaps the balance of nature called for one who wouldn't.

Whatever the ultimate truth of the matter, the fact now was that Death did
not have the slightest idea of when Rincewind was going to die.  This was
very vexing to a creature who prided himself on his punctuality.

A black and white bird appeared, and perched on his head.

"You know what to do," said the old man.

"Him?  What a wonga," said the bird.  "I've been lookin' at him.  He's not
even heroic.  He's just in the right place at the right time."

The old man indicated that this was maybe the definition of a hero.

"All right, but why not go and get the thing yerself?" said the bird.

"You've gotta have heroes," said the old man.

"And I suppose I'll have to help," said the bird.  It sniffed, which is
quite hard to do through a beak.

"Yep.  Off you go."

The bird shrugged, which /is/ easy to do if you have wings, and flew down

%passage 4
One day a group of senior novices, for mischief, kicked over the little
shrine that Lu-Tze kept beside his sleeping mat.

Next morning, no sweepers turned up for work.  They stayed in their huts
with the doors barred.  After making inquiries, the abbot, who at that time
was fifty years old again, summoned the three novices to his room.  There
were three brooms leaning against the wall.  He spoke as follows:

"You know that the dreadful Battle of Five Cities did not happen because
the messenger got there in time?"

They did.  You learned this early in your studies.  And they bowed
nervously, because this was the abbot, after all.

"And you know then that when the messenger's horse threw a shoe he espied
a man trudging beside the road carrying a small portable forge and pushing
an anvil on a barrow?"

They knew.

"And you know that man was Lu-tze?"

They did.

"Surely you know that Janda Trapp, Grand Master of /Oki-doki/, /Toro-fu/,
and /Chang-fu/, has only ever yielded to one man?"

They knew.

"And you know that man is Lu-Tze?"

They did.

"You know the little shrine you kicked over last night?"

They knew.

"You know it had an owner?"

There was silence.  Then the brightest of the novices looked up at the
abbot in horror, swallowed, picked up one of the three brooms, and walked
out of the room.

The other two were slower of brain and had to follow the story all the way
through to the end.

Then one of them said, "But it was only a sweeper's shrine!"

"You will take up the brooms and sweep," said the abbot, "and you will
sweep every day, and you will sweep until the day you find Lu-Tze and dare
to say 'Sweeper, it was I who knocked over and scattered your shrine and
now I will in humility accompany you to the dojo on the Tenth Djim, in
order to learn the Right Way.'  Only then, if you are still able, may you
resume your studies here.  Understood?"(1)

Older monks sometimes complained, but someone would always say:  "Remember
that Lu-Tze's Way is not our Way.  Remember he learned everything by
sweeping unheeded while students were being educated.  Remember, he has
been everywhere and done many things.  Perhaps he is a little... strange,
but remember he walked into a citadel full of armed men and traps and
nevertheless saw to it that the Pash of Muntab choked innocently on a fish
bone.  No monk is better than Lu-Tze at finding the Time and the Place."

Some, who did not know, would say:  "What is this Way that gives him so
much power?"

And they were told:  "It is the Way of Mrs. Marietta Cosmopolite, 3 Quirm
Street, Ankh-Morpork, Rooms To Rent Very Reasonable.  No, we don't
understand it, either.  Some subsendential rubbish, apparently."

(1) And the story continues:  The novice who had protested that it was only
the shrine of a sweeper ran away from the temple; the student who said
nothing remained a sweeper for the rest of his life; and the student who
has seen the inevitable shape of the story went, after much agonizing and
several months of meticulous sweeping, to Lu-Tze and knelt and asked to be
shown the Right Way.  Whereupon the sweeper took him to the dojo of the
Tenth Djim, with its terrible multibladed fighting machines and its
fearsome serrated weapons such as the /clong-clong/ and the /uppsi/.  The
story runs that the sweeper then opened a cupboard at the back of the dojo
and produced a broom and spake thusly:  "One hand /here/ and the other
/here/, understand?  People never get it right.  Use good, even strokes
and let the broom do most of the work.  Never try to sweep up a big pile,
you'll end up sweeping every bit of dust twice.  Use your dustpan wisely,
and remember:  a small brush for the corners."

"Well done.  I see you learned /something/, at least.  But one day it
seemed to me that everyone else had decided that wisdom can only be found a
long way off.  So I went to Ankh-Morpork.  They were all coming here, so it
seemed only fair.

"Seeking /enlightenment/?"

"No.  The wise man does not seek enlightenment, he waits for it.  So while
I was waiting, it occurred to me that seeking perplexity might be more
fun," said Lu-Tze.  "After all, enlightenment begins where perplexity ends.
And I found perplexity.  And a kind of enlightenment, too.  I had not been
there for five minutes, for example, when some men in an alley tried to
enlighten me of what little I possessed, giving me a valuable lesson in
the ridiculousness of material things."

The reason for the story was a mix of many things.  There was humanity's
desire to do forebidden deeds merely because they were forbidden.
There was its desire to find new horizons and kill the people who live
beyond them.  There were the mysterious scrolls.  There was the cucumber.
But mostly there was the knowledge that one day, it would all be over.

'Ah, well, life goes on,' people say when someone dies.  But from the
point of view of the person who has just died, it doesn't.  It's the
universe that goes on.  Just as the deceased was getting the hang of
everything it's all whisked away, by illness or accident or, in one
case, a cucumber.  Why this has to be is one of the imponderables of
life, in the face of which people either start to pray...
or become really, really angry.

"Not a contract, sir," said Jocasta, still paddling.

"The Guild council put it in abeyance, sir," said the patient swimmer.
"You're off the register.  They're not accepting contracts on you at

"And quite a few of the traps drop you into something deadly," said Vimes.

"Lucky for me that I fell into this one, eh, sir?"

"Oh, that one's deadly too," said Vimes.  "/Eventually/ deadly."  He
sighed.  He really wanted to discourage this sort of thing but... they'd
put him off the register?  It wasn't that he'd /liked/ being shot at by
hooded figures in the temporary employ of his many and varied enemies,
but he'd always looked at it as some kind of vote of confidence.  It
showed that he was annoying the rich and arrogant people who ought to be
annoyed.

Besides, the Assassin's Guild was easy to outwit.  They had strict rules,
which they followed quite honorably, and this was fine by Vimes, who, in
certain practical matters, had no rules whatever.

Off the register, eh?  The only other person not on it anymore, it was
rumored, was Lord Vetinari, the Patrician.  The Assassins understood the
political game in the city better than anyone, and if they took you off
the register it was because they felt that your departure would not only

'How can you protect yourself by carrying a sword if you don't know how
to use it?'

'Not me, sir.  Other people.  They see the sword and don't attack me,'
said Maladict patiently.

'Yes, but if they did, lad, you wouldn't be any good with it,' said the
sergeant.

'No, sir.  I'd probably settle for just ripping their heads off, sir.
That's what I mean by protection, sir.  Theirs, not mine.  And I'd get

/There was always a war./  Usually they were border disputes, the national
equivalent of complaining that the neighbor was letting their hedge grow
too long.  Sometimes they were bigger.  Borogravia was a peace-loving
country in the midst of treacherous, devious, warlike enemies.  They had
to be treacherous, devious, and warlike, otherwise we wouldn't be fighting
them, eh?  There was always a war.

A pigeon rose over the forests, banked slightly, and headed straight for
the valley of the Kneck.

Even from here, the black stone bulk of the Keep was visible, rising above
the sea of trees.  The pigeon sped on, one spark of purpose in the fresh
new morning--

--and squawked as darkness dropped from the sky, gripping it in talons of
steel.  Buzzard and pigeon tumbled for a moment, and then the buzzard
gained a little height and flapped onwards.

The pigeon thought: 000000000.  But had it been more capable of coherent
thought, and knew something about how birds of prey caught pigeons,(1) it
might have wondered why it was being gripped so... kindly.  It was being
held, not squeezed.  As it was, all it could think was 0000000!

(1) And allowing for the fact that all pigeons who knew how birds of prey
catch pigeons are dead, and therefore capable of slightly less thought
than a living pigeon.

Miss Tick was a sort of witch finder.  That seemed to be how witchcraft
worked.  Some witches kept a magical lookout for girls who showed promise,
and found them an older witch to help them along.  They didn't teach you
how to do it.  They taught you how to know what you were doing.

Witches were a bit like cats.  They didn't much like one another's company,
but they /did/ like to know where all the other witches were, just in case
they needed them.  And what you might need them for was to tell you, as a
friend, that you were beginning to cackle.

He wanted to sleep.  He'd never felt this tired before.  Vimes slumped to
his knees, and then fell sideways on to the sand.

When he forced his eyes open, he saw pale stars above him, and had, once
again, the sensation that there was someone else present.

He turned his head, wincing at the stab of pain, and saw a small but
brightly lit folding chair on the sand.  A robed figure was reclining in
it, reading a book.  A scythe was stuck in the sand beside it.

A white, skeletal hand turned a page.

'You'll be Death, then?' said Vimes, after a while.

AH, MISTER VIMES, ASTUTE AS EVER.  GOT IT IN ONE, said Death, shutting the
book on his finger to keep the place.

'I've seen you before.'

I HAVE WALKED WITH YOU MANY TIMES, MISTER VIMES.

'And this is /it/, is it?'

HAS IT NEVER STRUCK YOU THAT THE CONCEPT OF A WRITTEN NARRATIVE IS SOMEWHAT
STRANGE? said Death.

Vimes could tell when people were trying to avoid something they really
didn't want to say, and it was happening here.

'Is it?' he insisted.  'Is this it?  This time I die?'

COULD BE.

'Could be?  What sort of answer is that?' said Vimes.

A VERY ACCURATE ONE.  YOU SEE, YOU ARE HAVING A NEAR-DEATH EXPERIENCE,
WHICH INESCAPABLY MEANS THAT I MUST UNDERGO A NEAR-/VIMES/ EXPERIENCE.
DON'T MIND ME.  CARRY ON WITH WHATEVER YOU WERE DOING.  I HAVE A BOOK.

Vimes rolled over on to his stomach, gritted his teeth, and pushed himself
on to his hands and knees again.  He managed a few yards before slumping
back down.

He heard the sound of a chair being moved.

'Shouldn't you be somewhere else?' he said.

I AM, said Death, sitting down again.

'But you're here!'

AS WELL. Death turned a page and, for a person without breath, managed a
pretty good sigh.  IT APPEARS THAT THE BUTLER DID IT.

'Did what?'

IT IS A MADE-UP STORY.  VERY STRANGE.  ALL ONE NEEDS TO DO IS TURN TO THE

There was a story in the villages that the clock was Miss Treason's heart,

First Sight and Second Thoughts, that's what a witch had to rely on: First
Sight to see what's really there, and Second Thoughts to watch the First
Thoughts to check that they were thinking right.  Then there were the
Third Thoughts, which Tiffany had never heard discussed and therefore kept
quiet about; they were odd, seemed to think for themselves, and didn't
turn up very often.  And they were telling her that there was more to Miss
Treason than met the eye.

It was in fact Miss Tick who had written /Witch Hunting for Dumb People/,
and she made sure that copies of it found their way into those areas where
people still believed that witches should be burned or drowned.

Since the only witch ever likely to pass through these days was Miss Tick
herself, it meant that if things did go wrong, she'd get a good night's
sleep and a decent meal before being thrown into the water.  The water was
no problem at all for Miss Tick, who had been to the Quirm College for
Young Ladies, where you had to have an icy dip every morning to build Moral
Fiber.  And a No. 1 Bosun's knot was very easy to undo with your teeth,

Working quickly, she emptied her pockets and started a shamble.

Shambles worked.  That was about all you could say about them for certain.
You made them out of some string and a couple of sticks and anything you
had in your pocket at the time.  They were a witch's equivalent of those
knives with fifteen blades and three screwdrivers and a tiny magnifying
glass and a thing for extracting earwax from chickens.

You couldn't even say precisely what they did, although Miss Tick thought
that they were a way of finding out what things the hidden bits of your
own mind already knew.  You had to make a shamble from scratch every time,
and only from things in your pockets.  There was no harm in having
interesting things in your pockets, though, just in case.

That was practically cackling!  You had to deal every day with people who

could certainly end up thinking that the world would be considerably
improved if you gave them a slap.  But you didn't because, as Miss Tick

At the back of the Feegles' chalk pit, more chalk had been carved out of

In front of it stood Roland de Chumsfanleigh (it wasn't his fault).  His
ancestors had been knights, and they had come to own the Chalk by killing
the kings who thought they did.  Swords, that's what it had all been about.
Swords and cutting off heads.  That was how you got land in the old days,
and then the rules were changed so that you didn't need a sword to own
land anymore, you just needed the right piece of paper.  But his ancestors
had still hung on to their swords, just in case people thought that the
whole thing with the bits of paper had been unfair, it being a fact that
you can't please everybody.

He'd always wanted to be good with a sword, and it had come as a shock to
find that they were so /heavy/.  He was great at air sword.  In front of a
mirror he could fence against his reflection and win nearly all the time.
Real swords didn't allow that.  You tried to swing them and they ended up
swinging you.  He'd realized that maybe he was more cut out for bits of
paper.  Besides, he needed glasses, which could be a bit tricky under a

Technically, the city of Ankh-Morpork is a Tyranny, which is not always
the same thing as a monarchy, and in fact even the post of Tyrant has been
somewhat redefined by the incumbent, Lord Vetinari, as the only form of
democracy that works.  Everyone is entitled to vote, unless disqualified
by reason of age or not being Lord Vetinari.

And yet it does work.  This has annoyed a number of people who feel,
somehow, that it should not work, and who want a monarch instead, thus
replacing a man who has achieved his position by cunning, a deep
understanding of the realities of the human psyche, breathtaking
diplomancy, a certain prowess with the stiletto dagger, and, all agree,
a mind like a finely balanced circular saw, with a man who has got there
by being born.(1)

However, the crown has hung on anyway, as crowns do--on the Post Office
and the Royal Bank and the Mint and, not least, in the sprawling,
brawling, squalling consciousness of the city itself.  Lots of things
live in that darkness.  There are all kinds of darkness, and all kinds
of things can be found in them, imprisoned, banished, lost or hidden.
Sometimes they escape.  Sometimes they simply fall out.  Sometimes they
just can't take it any more.

"Yes, sir?" said Ponder wearily.

"Promote him.  Whatever level he is, move him up one."

"I think that'll send the wrong kind of signal," Ponder tried.

"On the contrary, Mister Stibbons.  It will send exactly the right kind of
message to the student body."

"But he disobeyed an express order, may I point out?"

"That's right.  He showed independent thinking and a certain amount of
pluck, and in the course of so doing added valuable data to our
understanding of the Cabinet."

"But he might have destroyed the whole university, sir."

"Right, in which case he would have been vigorously disciplined, if we'd
been able to find anything left of him.  But he didn't and he was lucky
and we need lucky wizards.  Promote him, on the direct order of me, not
pp'd at all.  Incidentally, how loud were his screams?"

"You will arrange yourself into two teams, set up goals, and strive to win!
No man will leave the field of play unless injured!  The hands are not to
be used, is that clear?  Any questions?"  A hand went up.  Ridcully sought
the attached face.

"Ah, Rincewind," he said, and, because he was not a determinedly unpleasant
man, amended this to, "Professor Rincewind, of course."

"I would like permission to fetch a note from my mother, sir."

Ridcully sighed.  "Rincewind, you once informed me, to my everlasting
puzzlement, that you never knew your mother because she ran away before
you were born.  Distinctly remember writing it down in my diary.  Would
you like another try?"

"Permission to go and find my mother?"

Ridcully hesitated.  The Professor of Cruel and Unusual Geography had no
students and no real duties other than to stay out of trouble.  Although
Ridcully would never admit it, it was against all reason an emeritus
position.  Rincewind was a coward and an unwitting clown, but he had
several times saved the world in slightly puzzling circumstances.  He was
a luck sink, the Archchancellor decided, doomed to being a lightning rod
for the fates so that everyone else didn't have to.  Such a person was
worth all his meals and laundry (including an above-average level of
soiled pants) and a bucket of coal every day even if he was, in Ridcully's
opinion, a bit of a whiner.  However, he was fast, and therefore useful.

"Look," said Rincewind, "a mysterious urn turns up and suddenly it's all
about football.  That bodes.  It means that something bad is going to
happen."

"Come now, it could be something wonderful," Ridcully protested.

Rincewind appeared to give this due consideration.  "Could be wonderful,
will be dreadful.  Sorry, that's how it goes."

"This is Unseen University, Rincewind.  What is there to fear?" Ridcully
said.  "Apart from me, of course.  Good heavens, this is a sport."  He
raised his voice.  "Arrange yourselves into two teams and play football!"

them a show.  I want you to approach this in the best traditions of Unseen
University sportsmanship, which is to cheat whenever you are unobserved,
though I fear that the chance of anyone being unobserved today is remote.
But in any case, I want you to give it one hundred and ten percent."

"Excuse me, Archchancellor," said Ponder Stibbons.  "I understand the
sense of what you are saying, but there is only one hundred percent."

"Well, they could give it one hundred and ten percent if they tried
harder," said Ridcully.

"Well, yes and no, sir.  But, in fact, that would mean that you had just
made the one hundred percent bigger while it would still be one hundred
percent.  Besides, there is only so fast a man can run, only so high a man
can jump.  I just wanted to make the point."

The singing of the National Anthem was always a ragged affair, the good
people of Ankh-Morpork feeling that it was unpatriotic to sing songs about
how patriotic you were, taking the view that someone singing a song about
how patriotic they were was either up to something or a Head of State.(1)

An additional problem today lay in the acoustics of the arena, which were
rather too good, coupled with the fact that the speed of sound at one end
of the stadium was slightly offbeat compared with the other end, a
drawback exacerbated when both sides tried to recover the gap.

These acoustical anomalies did not count for much if you were standing
next to Mustrum Ridcully, as the Archchancellor was one of those gentleman
who will sing it beautifully, correctly enunciated and very, very loudly.

"'When dragons belch and hippos flee, my thoughts, Ankh-Morpork, are of
thee.'" he began.

(1) i.e., up to something.

It is important that we know where we come from, because if you do not
know where you come from, then you don't know where you are, and if you

don't know where you're going, you're probably going wrong.

There is a lot of folklore about equestrian statues, especially the ones
with riders on them.  There is said to be a code in the number and
placement of the horse's hooves:  If one of the horse's hooves is in the
air, the rider was wounded in battle; two legs in the air means that the
rider was killed in battle; three legs in the air indicates that the
rider got lost on the way to the battle; and four legs in the air means
that the sculptor was very, very clever.  Five legs in the air means that
there's probably at least one other horse standing behind the one you're
looking at; and the rider lying on the ground with his horse lying on top
of him with all four legs in the air means that the rider was either a
very incompetent horseman or owned a very bad-tempered horse.

Tiffany crawled a little farther, well aware of the sheer drop an inch
away from her hand.  "Preston has gone to fetch a rope.  Do you have a
broomstick?"

"A sheep crashed into it," said Mrs. Proust.

Tiffany could just make her out now.  "You crashed into a sheep in
/the air/?"

"Maybe it was a cow, or something.  What are those things that go
/snuffle snuffle/?"

"You ran into a flying hedgehog?"

"No, as it happened.  We were down low, looking for a bush for Mrs.
Happenstance."  There was a sigh in the gloom.  "It's because of her
trouble, poor soul.  We've stopped at a lot of bushes on the way here,
believe me!  And do you know what?  Inside every single one of them is
something that stings, bites, kicks, screams, howls, squelches, farts
enormously, goes all spiky, tries to knock you over, or does an enormous

Tiffany was taken aback.  "Well, yes, but not in the fields!"

Rhys Rhysson, Low King of the dwarfs, was a dwarf of keen intelligence,
but he sometimes wondered why someone with that intelligence would go into
dwarfish politics, let alone be King of the Dwarfs.  Lord Vetinari had it
so easy he must hardly know he was born!  The King thought that humans
were, well, reasonably sensible, whereas there was an old dwarf proverb
which, translated, said, "Any three dwarfs having a sensible conversation
will always end up having four points of view."

Curious, the Patrician thought, as Drumknott hurried away to dispatch a
clacks to the editor of the /Times/, that people in Ankh-Morpork professed
not to like change while at the same time fixating on every new
entertainment and diversion that came their way.  There was nothing the
mob liked better than novelty.  Lord Vetinari sighed again.  Did they
actually think?  These days /everybody/ used the clacks, even little old
ladies who used it to send him clacks messages complaining about all
these newfangled ideas, totally missing the irony.  And in this doleful
mood he ventured to wonder if they ever thought back to when things were
just old-fangled or not fangled at all as against the modern day when
fangled had reached its apogee.  Fangling was indeed, he thought, here
to stay.  Then he wondered: had anyone ever thought of themselves as a

There clearly has been magic at work in the Netherglades and its future as
the pharmacopoeia of the world is being tested by Professor Rincewind of
Unseen University.  A dispatch from him reveals that the juice pressed from
a certain little yellow flower induces certainty in the patient for up to
fifteen minutes.  About what they are certain they cannot specify, but the
patient is, in that short time, completely certain about /everything/.  And
further research has found that a floating water hyacinth yields in its
juices total /un/certainty about anything for half a hour.  Philosophers
are excited about the uses for these potions, and the search continues for
a plant that combines the qualities of both, thereby being of great use to
theologians.

The town of Big Cabbage, theoretically the last place any sensible person

of the attractions of Brassica World and the Cabbage Research Institute,
whose students were the first to get a cabbage to a height of five hundred
yards propelled entirely by its own juices.  Nobody asked why they felt it
was necessary to do this, but that was science for you, and, of course,

A few weeks later, Drumknott persuaded Lord Vetinari to accompany him to
the area behind the palace where a jungle of drain pipes emptied and
several mismatched sheds, washhouses, and lean-tos housed some of the
necessary functions without which a modern palace could not operate.(1)

There was a young goblin waiting there, rather nervous, clasping what
looked like two wheels held together by not very much.  The wheels were
spinning.

Durmknott cleared his throat.  "Show his lordship your new invention,

	For it had been long apparent to Count Landulf that nothing
	could be done with his seventh son Thomas, except to make him
	an Abbot or something of that kind.  Born in 1226, he had from
	childhood a mysterious objection to becoming a predatory eagle,
	or even to taking an ordinary interest in falconry or tilting
	or any other gentlemanly pursuits.  He was a large and heavy and
	quiet boy, and phenomenally silent, scarcely opening his mouth
	except to say suddenly to his schoolmaster in an explosive
	manner, "What is God?"  The answer is not recorded but it is
	probable that the asker went on worrying out answers for himself.

	"The last spot on the school jousting team came down to another

	a brand new suit of chain mail.  Just before our joust, I asked
	him what he'd do if he made the team.  (I was hoping to be more
	popular with the ladies.)  He said he would be able to save the
	town from dragons and be able to afford some water for his 20
	brothers and sisters.

	Well, a sense of compassion came over me.  I insisted we swap
	armor.  He was forced to accept, as it would have been an

	Probably most commonly associated with trapping, the leghold
	trap is a rather simple mechanical trap.  It is made up of two
	jaws, a spring of some sort, and a trigger in the middle.  When
	the animal steps on the trigger the trap closes around the leg,
	holding the animal in place.  Usually some kind of lure is used
	to position the animal, or the trap is set on an animal trail.
	Traditionally, leghold traps had tightly closing "teeth" to make
	sure the animal stayed in place.  The teeth also made sure the
	animal could not move the leg in the trap and ruin their fur.
	However, this resulted in many animals gnawing off legs in order
	to escape.  More modern traps have a gap called an "offset jaw"
	and work more like a handcuff.  They grip above the paw, making
	sure the animal cannot pull out but does not destroy the leg.
	This also allows the trapper to release unwanted catches.

	Only once a year, on his birthday, did Charlie Bucket ever
	get to taste a bit of chocolate.  The whole family saved up
	their money for that special occasion, and when the great
	day arrived, Charlie was always presented with one small
	chocolate bar to eat all by himself.  And each time he
	received it, on those marvelous birthday mornings, he would
	place it carefully in a small wooden box that he owned, and
	treasure it as though it were a bar of solid gold; and for
	the next few days, he would allow himself only to look at it,
	but never to touch it.  Then at last, when he could stand it
	no longer, he would peel back a tiny bit of the paper
	wrapping at one corner to expose a tiny bit of chocolate, and
	then he would take a tiny nibble - just enough to allow the
	lovely sweet taste to spread out slowly over his tongue.  The
	next day, he would take another tiny nibble, and so on, and
	so on.  And in this way, Charlie would make his ten-cent bar
	of birthday chocolate last him for more than a month.

	Of all the monsters put together by the Greek imagination
	the Centaurs (Kentauroi) constituted a class in themselves.
	Despite a strong streak of sensuality, in their make-up,
	their normal behaviour was moral, and they took a kindly
	thought of man's welfare.  The attempted outrage of Nessos on
	Deianeira, and that of the whole tribe of Centaurs on the
	Lapith women, are more than offset by the hospitality of
	Pholos and by the wisdom of Cheiron, physician, prophet,
	lyrist, and the instructor of Achilles.  Further, the
	Centaurs were peculiar in that their nature, which united the
	body of a horse with the trunk and head of a man, involved
	an unthinkable duplication of vital organs and important
	members.  So grotesque a combination seems almost un-Greek.

	preferring to live in bleak and desolate regions, whenever it
	was seen among men it left in its wake a trail of destruction

	Dwarfs have faces like men (ugly men, with wrinkled, leathery
	skins), but are generally either flat-footed, duck-footed, or
	have feet pointing backwards.  They are of the earth, earthy,
	living in the darkest of caverns and venturing forth only
	with the cloaks by which they can make themselves invisible,
	and others disguised as toads.  Miners often come across them,
	and sometimes establish reasonably close relations with them.
	... The miners of Cornwall were always delighted to hear a
	bucca busily mining away, for all dwarfs have an infallible
	nose for precious metals.
	Among other things, dwarfs are rightly valued for their skill
	as blacksmiths and jewellers: they made Odin his famous spear
	Gungnir, and Thor his hammer; for Freya they designed a
	magnificent necklace, and for Frey a golden boar.  And in their
	spare time they are excellent bakers.  Ironically, despite
	their odd feet, they are particularly fond of dancing.  They
	can also see into the future, and consequently are excellent
	meteorologists.  They can be free with presents to people
	they like, and a dwarvish gift is likely to turn to gold in
	the hand.  But on the whole they are a snappish lot.

	Fungi, division of simple plants that lack chlorophyll, true
	stems, roots, and leaves.  Unlike algae, fungi cannot
	photosynthesize, and live as parasites or saprophytes.  The
	division comprises the slime molds and true fungi.  True
	fungi are multicellular (with the exception of yeasts); the
	body of most true fungi consists of slender cottony
	filaments, or hyphae.  All fungi are capable of asexual
	reproduction by cell division, budding, fragmentation, or
	spores.  Those that reproduce sexually alternate a sexual
	generation (gametophyte) with a spore-producing one.  The
	four classes of true fungi are the algaelike fungi (e.g.,
	black bread mold and downy mildew), sac fungi (e.g., yeasts,
	powdery mildews, truffles, and blue and green molds such as
	Penicillium), basidium fungi (e.g., mushrooms and puffballs)
	and imperfect fungi (e.g., species that cause athlete's foot
	and ringworm).  Fungi help decompose organic matter (important
	in soil renewal); are valuable as a source of antibiotics,
	vitamins, and various chemicals; and for their role in
	fermentation, e.g., in bread and alcoholic beverage
	production.

	And now the souls of the dead who had gone below came swarming
	up from Erebus -- fresh brides, unmarried youths, old men
	with life's long suffering behind them, tender young girls
	still nursing this first anguish in their hearts, and a great
	throng of warriors killed in battle, their spear-wounds gaping
	yet and all their armour stained with blood.  From this
	multitude of souls, as they fluttered to and fro by the
	trench, there came a moaning that was horrible to hear.
	Panic drained the blood from my cheeks.
	     [ The Odyssey, (chapter Lambda), by Homer ]
	The forces of the gloom know each other, and are strangely
	balanced by each other.  Teeth and claws fear what they cannot
	grasp.  Blood-drinking bestiality, voracious appetites, hunger
	in search of prey, the armed instincts of nails and jaws which
	have for source and aim the belly, glare and smell out
	uneasily the impassive spectral forms straying beneath a
	shroud, erect in its vague and shuddering robe, and which seem
	to them to live with a dead and terrible life.  These
	brutalities, which are only matter, entertain a confused fear
	of having to deal with the immense obscurity condensed into an
	unknown being.  A black figure barring the way stops the wild
	beast short.  That which emerges from the cemetery intimidates
	and disconcerts that which emerges from the cave; the
	ferocious fear the sinister; wolves recoil when they encounter
	a ghoul.

	Giants have always walked the earth, though they are rare in
	these times.  They range in size from little over nine feet
	to a towering twenty feet or more.  The larger ones use huge
	boulders as weapons, hurling them over large distances.  All
	types of giants share a love for men - roasted, boiled, or
	fried.  Their table manners are legendary.
	...  And then a gnome came by, carrying a bundle, an old
	fellow three times as large as an imp and wearing clothes of
	a sort, especially a hat.  And he was clearly just as frightened
	as the imps though he could not go so fast.  Ramon Alonzo
	saw that there must be some great trouble that was vexing
	magical things; and, since gnomes speak the language of men, and
	will answer if spoken to gently, he raised his hat, and asked
	of the gnome his name.  The gnome did not stop his hasty
	shuffle a moment as he answered 'Alaraba' and grabbed the rim
	of his hat but forgot to doff it.
	'What is the trouble, Alaraba?'  said Ramon Alonzo.
	'White magic.  Run!'  said the gnome ..

	"Muggles have garden gnomes, too, you know," Harry told Ron as
	they crossed the lawn.
	"Yeah, I've seen those things they think are gnomes," said Ron,
	bent double with his head in a peony bush, "like fat little
	Santa Clauses with fishing rods..."
	There was a violent scuffling noise, the peony bush shuddered,
	and Ron straightened up.  "This is a gnome," he said grimly.
	"Geroff me! Gerroff me!" squealed the gnome.
	It was certainly nothing like Santa Claus.  It was small and
	leathery looking, with a large, knobby, bald head exactly like

	to have made the world, and this is indeed a likely claim in
	the case of threesomes or pantheons:  Fantasyland does have
	the air of having been made by a committee.  But all Goddesses
	and Gods, whether they say they made the world or not, have
	very detailed short-term plans for it which they are determined
	to carry out.  Consequently they tend to push people into the
	required actions by the use of coincidence or Prophecy, or just
	by narrowing down your available choices of what to do next:
	if a deity is pushing you, things will go miserably badly until
	there is only one choice left to you.

	"The original story harks back, so they say, to the sixteenth
	century.  Using long-lost formulas from the Kabbala, a rabbi is
	said to have made an artificial man -- the so-called Golem -- to
	help ring the bells in the Synagogue and for all kinds of other
	menial work.
	"But he hadn't made a full man, and it was animated by some sort
	of vegetable half-life.  What life it had, too, so the story
	runs, was only derived from the magic charm placed behind its
	teeth each day, that drew down to itself what was known as the
	`free sidereal strength of the universe.'
	"One evening, before evening prayers, the rabbi forgot to take
	the charm out of the Golem's mouth, and it fell into a frenzy.
	It raged through the dark streets, smashing everything in its
	path, until the rabbi caught up with it, removed the charm, and
	destroyed it.  Then the Golem collapsed, lifeless.  All that was
	left of it was a small clay image, which you can still see in

	Hobgoblin.  Used by the Puritans and in later times for

	Now Issek of the Jug, whom Fafhrd chose to serve, was once
	of the most lowly and unsuccessful of the gods, godlets
	rather, in Lankhmar.  He had dwelt there for about thirteen
	years, during which time he had traveled only two squares up
	the Street of the Gods and was now back again, ready for
	oblivion.  He is not to be confused with Issek the Armless,
	Issek of the Burnt Legs, Flayed Issek, or any other of the
	numerous and colorfully mutilated divinities of that name.
	Indeed, his unpopularity may have been due in part to the

	deemed particularly spectacular. ... However, after Fafhrd
	became his acolyte, things somehow began to change.

	The shopkeeper of the lighting shop in the town level of the
	gnomish mines is a tribute to Izchak Miller, a founding member
	of the NetHack development team and a personal friend of a large
	number of us.  Izchak contributed greatly to the game, coding a
	large amount of the shopkeep logic (hence the nature of the tribute)
	as well as a good part of the alignment system, the prayer code and
	the rewrite of "hell" in the 3.1 release.  Izchak was a professor
	of Philosophy, who taught at many respected institutions, including
	MIT and Stanford, and who also worked, for a period of time, at
	Xerox PARC.  Izchak was the first "librarian" of the NetHack project,
	and was a founding member of the DevTeam, joining in 1986 while he
	was working at the University of Pennsylvania (hence our former
	mailing list address).  Until the 3.1.3 release, Izchak carefully
	kept all of the code synchronized and arbitrated disputes between
	members of the development teams.  Izchak Miller passed away at the
	age of 58, in the early morning hours of April 1, 1994 from
	complications due to cancer.  We then dedicated NetHack 3.2 in his
	memory.

	In Asiatic folktale, jackal provides for the lion; he scares
	up game, which the lion kills and eats, and receives what is
	left as reward.  In stories from northern India he is

	From the legend that he does not kill his own food has arisen
	the legend of his cowardice.  Jackal's heart must never be
	eaten, for instance, in the belief of peoples indigenous to
	the regions where the jackal abounds. ... In Hausa Negro

	The kabuto is the helmet worn by the samurai.  It was
	characterized by a prominent beaked front which jutted out over
	the brow to protect the wearer's face; a feature that gives
	rise to their modern Japanese name of 'shokaku tsuki kabuto'
	(battering-ram helmet).  Their main constructional element
	was an oval plate, the shokaku bo, slightly domed for the
	head with a narrow prolongation in front that curved forwards
	and downwards where it developed a pronounced central
	fold.  Two horizontal strips encircling the head were riveted
	to this frontal strip:  the lower one, the koshimaki (hip
	wrap), formed the lower edge of the helmet bowl; the other,
	the do maki (body wrap), was set at about the level of the
	temples.  Filling the gaps between these strips and the shokaku
	bo were small plates, sometimes triangular but more commonly
	rectangular in shape.  Because the front projected so
	far from the head, the triangular gap beneath was filled by
	a small plate, the shoshaku tei ita, whose rear edge bent
	downwards into a flange that rested against the forehead.

	The race of kobolds are reputed to be an artificial creation
	of a master wizard (demi-god?).  They are about 3' tall with
	a vaguely dog-like face.  They bear a violent dislike of the
	Elven race, and will go out of their way to cause trouble
	for Elves at any time.
	The Kops are a brilliant concept.  To take a gaggle of inept
	policemen and display them over and over again in a series of
	riotously funny physical punishments plays equally well to the
	peanut gallery and the expensive box seats.  People hate cops.
	Even people who have never had anything to do with cops hate
	them.  Of course, we count on them to keep order and to protect
	us when we need protecting, and we love them on television shows
	in which they have nerves of steel and hearts of gold, but in
	the abstract, as a nation, collectively we hate them.  They are
	too much like high school principals.  We're very happy to see
	their pants fall down, and they look good to us with pie on
	their faces.  The Keystone Kops turn up--and they get punished
	for it, as they crash into each other, fall down, and suffer
	indignity after indignity.  Here is pure movie satisfaction.

	The Kops are very skillfully presented.  The comic originality
	and timing in one of their chase scenes requires imagination
	to think up, talent to execute, understanding of the medium,
	and, of course, raw courage to perform.  The Kops are madmen
	presented as incompetents, and they're madmen rushing around
	in modern machines.  What's more, the machines they were operating
	in their routines were newly invented and not yet experienced
	by the average moviegoer.  (In the early days of automobiles,
	it was reported that there were only two cars registered in all

	lacking iris or pupil, and they glowed from within.

	The room was silent as she scrabbled in her box of pieces and,
	from the very bottom, produced a couple that she set down on
	the board with two decisive clicks.  The rest of the players,

	You are on the edge of a breath-taking view.  Far below you
	is an active volcano, from which great gouts of molten lava
	come surging out, cascading back down into the depths.  The
	glowing rock fills the farthest reaches of the cavern with a
	blood-red glare, giving everything an eerie, macabre appearance.
	The air is filled with flickering sparks of ash and a heavy
	smell of brimstone.  The walls are hot to the touch, and the
	thundering of the volcano drowns out all other sounds.
	Embedded in the jagged roof far overhead are myriad twisted
	formations composed of pure white alabaster, which scatter the
	murky light into sinister apparitions upon the walls.  To one
	side is a deep gorge, filled with a bizarre chaos of tortured
	rock which seems to have been crafted by the devil himself.
	An immense river of fire crashes out from the depths of the

	bottomless pit far off to your left.  To the right, an immense
	geyser of blistering steam erupts continuously from a barren
	island in the center of a sulfurous lake, which bubbles

	of some ancient king still crowned with untarnished gold but
	turning to my gaze a visage that more than time or the worm had

	above the crown that was set with sapphires and orange rubies, a
	black something swayed and nodded horribly; but, for an instant,
	I did not dream what it was.  Then, in its middle, two oblique
	and scarlet eyes opened and glowed like hellish coals, and two

	Lugh, or Lug, was the sun god of the Irish Celts.  One of his
	weapons was a rod-sling which worshippers sometimes saw in
	the sky as a rainbow.  As a tribal god, he was particularly
	skilled in the use of his massive, invincible spear, which
	fought on its own accord.  One of his epithets is _lamfhada_
	(of the long arm).  He was a young and apparently more
	attractive deity than Dagda, the father of the gods.  Being
	able to shapeshift, his name translates as lynx.

	The people were empowered to "assemble with javelins,
	halberds, pikes, arquebuses and clubs, to hunt and pursue the
	said were-wolf in all places where they could find it, and to
	take, burn, and kill it, without incurring any fine or other
	penalty."  The hunt seems to have been successful, if we may
	judge from the fact that the same tribunal in the following
	year condemned to be burned a man named Giles Garnier, who
	ran on all fours in the forest and fields and devoured little
	children, "even on Friday."  The poor lycanthrope, it appears,
	had as slight respect for ecclesiastical feasts as the French

	10,000 eyes and ears and rides in a chariot drawn by white
	horses.  Mithra, according to Zarathustra, is concerned with
	the endless battle between light and dark forces:  he

	One day, an army general invited the Buddhist monk I-Hsiu
	(literally, "One Rest") to his military head office for a
	dinner.  I-Hsiu was not accustomed to wearing luxurious
	clothings and so he just put on an old ordinary casual
	robe to go to the military base.  To him, "form is void".

	As he approached the base, two soldiers appeared before him
	and shouted, "Where does this beggar came from?  Identify
	yourself!  You do not have permission to be around here!"

	"My name is I-Hsiu Dharma Master.  I am invited by your
	general for a supper."

	The two soldiers examined the monk closely and said, "You

	dinner?  He invites the very solemn venerable I-Hsiu to our
	base for a great ceremony today, not you.  Now, get out!"

	I-Hsiu was unable to convince the soldiers that he was
	indeed the invited guest, so he returned to the temple
	and changed to a very formal solemn ceremonial robe for
	the dinner.  And as he returned to the military base, the
	soldiers observed that he was such a great Buddhist monk,
	let him in with honour.

	At the dinner, I-Hsiu sat in front of the table full of
	food but, instead of putting the food into his mouth, he
	picked up the food with his chopsticks and put it into
	his sleeves.  The general was curious, and whispered to
	him, "This is very embarrassing.  Do you want to take
	some food back to the temple?  I will order the cook to
	prepare some take out orders for you."  "No" replied the
	monk.  "When I came here, I was not allowed into the
	base by your soldiers until I wear this ceremonial robe.

	A volcanic glass, homogeneous in texture and having a low water
	content, with a vitreous luster and a conchoidal fracture.  The
	color is commonly black, but may be some shade of red or brown,
	and cut sections sometimes appear to be green.  Like other
	volcanic glasses, obsidian is a lava that has cooled too quickly
	for the contained minerals to crystallize.  In chemical
	composition it is rich in silica and similar to granite.  It is
	favored by primitive peoples for knives, arrowheads, spearheads,

	Also called Sigtyr (god of Victory), Val-father (father of
	the slain), One-Eyed, Hanga-god (god of the hanged), Farma-
	god (god of cargoes), Hapta-god (god of prisoners), and
	Othin.  He is the prime god of the Norsemen:  god of war and
	victory, wisdom and prophecy, poetry, the dead, air and wind,
	hospitality, and magic.
	As the god of war and victory, Odin is ruler of the Valkyries,
	warrior-maidens who lived in the halls of Valhalla in Asgard,
	the hall of dead heroes where he held his court.
	These chosen ones will defend the realm of the gods against
	the Frost Giants on the final day of reckoning, Ragnarok.
	As god of the wind, Odin rides through the air on his eight-
	footed horse, Sleipnir, wielding Gungner, his spear, normally
	accompanied by his ravens, Hugin and Munin, who he would also
	use as his spies.
	As a god of hospitality, he enjoys visiting the earth in
	disguise to see how people were behaving and to see how they
	would treat him, not knowing who he was.
	Odin is usually represented as a one-eyed wise old man with a
	long white beard and a wide-brimmed hat (he gave one of his
	eyes to Mimir, the guardian of the well of wisdom in Hel, in
	exchange for a draught of knowledge).
	Anyone who has met a gluttonous, nude, angry ogre, will not
	easily forget this encounter -- if he survives it at all.
	Both male and female ogres can easily grow as tall as three
	metres.  Build and facial expressions would remind one of a
	Neanderthal.  Its small, pointy, keen teeth are striking.
	Since ogres avoid direct sunlight, their ragged, unfurry
	skin is as white as a sheet.  They enjoy coating their body
	with lard and usually wear nothing but a loin-cloth.  An elf
	would smell its rancid stench at ten metres distance.
	Ogres are solitary creatures:  very rarely one may encounter
	a female with two or three young.  They are the only real
	carnivores among the humanoids, and its favourite meal is --
	not surprisingly -- human flesh.  They sometimes ally with
	orcs or goblins, but only when they anticipate a good meaty
	meal.

	This Orb is a crystal ball of exceptional powers.  When
	carried, it grants ESP, limits damage done by spells, and
	protects the carrier from magic missiles.  When invoked it
	allows the carrier to become invisible.
	Some say that Odin himself created this ancient crystal ball,
	although others argue that Loki created it and forged Odin's
	signature on the bottom.  In any case, it is a powerful

	is only moderately intelligent, has broad, muscled shoulders,
	a short neck, a sloping forehead and a thick, dark fur.
	Their lower eye-teeth are pointing forward, like a boar's.
	Female orcs are more lightly built and bare-chested.  Not
	needing any clothing, they do like to dress in variegated
	apparels.  Suspicious by nature, orcs live in tribes or
	hordes.  They tend to live underground as well as above
	ground (but they dislike sunlight).  Orcs can use all weapons,

	Orion was the son of Neptune. He was a handsome giant and a

	through the depths of the sea, or, as others say, of
	walking on its surface.

	He dwelt as a hunter with Diana (Artemis), with whom he
	was a favourite, and it is even said she was about to marry
	him. Her brother was highly displeased and often chid her,
	but to no purpose. One day, observing Orion wading through
	the sea with his head just above the water, Apollo pointed
	it out to his sister and maintained that she could not hit
	that black thing on the sea. The archer-goddess discharged
	a shaft with fatal aim. The waves rolled the dead body of
	Orion to the land, and bewailing her fatal error with many

	Some players, who unconsciously perceive Paper as weak or a

	drop it from their game when they are falling behind.  On the
	other hand, Paper also connects with a player's perceptions

	It has the ability to lay off thousands of employees, declare
	war against nations, spread scandal or confess love.  Paper,
	in short, has power over masses.  The fate of the entire world

	Conan cried out sharply and recoiled, thrusting his companion

	"When time came for the shepherds to hold their customary
	assembly in order to prepare their monthly report to the king
	about the state of the flocks, he came too, wearing this ring.
	While he was sitting with the others, it chanced that he moved
	the collet of the ring around toward himself into the inside of
	his hand; having done this, he disappeared from the sight of
	those who were sitting beside him, and they discussed of him as
	of someone who had left.  And he wondered and once again feeling
	for the ring, he turned the collet outwards and, by turning it,
	reappeared.  Reflecting upon this, he put the ring to the test
	to see if it indeed had such power, and he came to this
	conclusion that, by turning the collet inwards, he became
	invisible, outwards, visible.  Having perceived this, he at
	once managed for himself to become one of the envoys to the
	king; upon arrival, having seduced his wife, with her help,
	he laid a hand on the king, murdered him and took hold of the

	Bilbo saw that the moment had come when he must do something.
	He could not get up at the brutes and he had nothing to shoot
	with; but looking about he saw that in this place there were
	many stones lying in what appeared to be a now dry little
	watercourse.  Bilbo was a pretty fair shot with a stone, and
	it did not take him long to find a nice smooth egg-shaped one
	that fitted his hand cosily.  As a boy he used to practise
	throwing stones at things, until rabbits and squirrels, and
	even birds, got out of his way as quick as lightning if they
	saw him stoop; and even grownup he had still spent a deal of
	his time at quoits, dart-throwing, shooting at the wand,
	bowls, ninepins and other quiet games of the aiming and
	throwing sort - indeed he could do lots of things, besides
	blowing smoke-rings, asking riddles and cooking, that I
	haven't time to tell you about.  There is no time now.  While
	he was picking up stones, the spider had reached Bombur, and
	soon he would have been dead.  At that moment Bilbo threw.
	The stone struck the spider plunk on the head, and it dropped
	senseless off the tree, flop to the ground, with all its legs
	curled up.

	Ildefonse left the terrace and almost immediately sounds
	of contention came from the direction of the work-room.
	Ildefonse presently returned to the terrace, followed by
	Osherl and a second sandestin using the guise of a gaunt blue
	bird-like creature, some six feet in height.

	Ildefonse spoke in scathing tones:  "Behold these two
	creatures!  They can roam the chronoplex as easily as you
	or I can walk around the table; yet neither has the wit to
	announce his presence upon arrival.  I found Osherl asleep

	The name _Sasquatch_ doesn't really become important in Canada
	until the 1930s, when it appeared in the works of J. W. Burns,
	a British Columbian writer who used a great deal of Indian
	lore in his stories.  Burn's Sasquatch was a giant Indian who
	lived in the wilderness.  He was hairy only in the sense that
	he had long hair on his head, and while this Sasquatch lived a
	wild and primitive life, he was fully human.
	Burns's character proved to be quite popular.  There was a
	Sasquatch Inn near the town of Harrison, British Columbia, and
	Harrison even had a local celebration called "Sasquatch Days."
	The celebration which had been dormant for years was revived
	as part of British Columbia's centennial, and one of the
	events was to be a Sasquatch hunt.  The hunt never took place,
	perhaps it was never supposed to, but the publicity about it
	did bring out a number of people who said they had encountered
	a Sasquatch -- not Burns's giant Indian, but the hairy apelike
	creature that we have all come to know.

	There have been three general theories put forward to explain
	the phenomenon of the wandering shops or, as they are
	generically known, _tabernae vagantes._
	The first postulates that many thousands of years ago there
	evolved somewhere in the multiverse a race whose single talent
	was to buy cheap and sell dear.  Soon they controlled a vast
	galactic empire or, as they put it, Emporium, and the more
	advanced members of the species found a way to equip their very
	shops with unique propulsion units that could break the dark
	walls of space itself and open up vast new markets.  And long
	after the worlds of the Emporium perished in the heat death of
	their particular universe, after one last defiant fire sale,
	the wandering starshops still ply their trade, eating their way
	through the pages of spacetime like a worm through a three-
	volume novel.
	The second is that they are the creation of a sympathetic Fate,
	charged with the role of supplying exactly the right thing
	at the right time.
	The third is that they are simply a very clever way of getting
	around the various Sunday Closing acts.
	All these theories, diverse as they are, have two things in
	common.  They explain the observed facts, and they are
	completely and utterly wrong.

	Then at last he began to wonder why the lion was standing so
	still - for it hadn't moved one inch since he first set eyes
	on it.  Edmund now ventured a little nearer, still keeping in
	the shadow of the arch as much as he could.  He now saw from
	the way the lion was standing that it couldn't have been
	looking at him at all.  ("But supposing it turns its head?"
	thought Edmund.)  In fact it was staring at something else -
	namely a little dwarf who stood with his back to it about
	four feet away.  "Aha!" thought Edmund.  "When it springs at
	the dwarf then will be my chance to escape."  But still the
	lion never moved, nor did the dwarf.  And now at last Edmund
	remembered what the others had said about the White Witch
	turning people into stone.  Perhaps this was only a stone
	lion.  And as soon as he had thought of that he noticed that
	the lion's back and the top of its head were covered with
	snow.  Of course it must be only a statue!

	There was the usual dim grey light of the forest-day about
	him when he came to his senses.  The spider lay dead beside
	him, and his sword-blade was stained black.  Somehow the
	killing of the giant spider, all alone and by himself in the
	dark without the help of the wizard or the dwarves or of
	anyone else, made a great difference to Mr. Baggins.  He felt
	a different person, and much fiercer and bolder in spite of
	an empty stomach, as he wiped his sword on the grass and put
	it back into its sheath.
	"I will give you a name," he said to it, "and I shall call
	you Sting."
		[ The Hobbit, by J.R.R. Tolkien ]
	There were sounds in the distance, incongruent with the
	sounds of even this nameless, timeless sea: thin sounds,
	agonized and terrible, for all that they remained remote -
	yet the ship followed them, as if drawn by them; they grew
	louder - pain and despair were there, but terror was
	predominant.
	Elric had heard such sounds echoing from his cousin Yyrkoon's
	sardonically named 'Pleasure Chambers' in the days before he
	had fled the responsibilities of ruling all that remained of
	the old Melnibonean Empire.  These were the voices of men
	whose very souls were under siege; men to whom death meant
	not mere extinction, but a continuation of existence, forever
	in thrall to some cruel and supernatural master.  He had
	heard men cry so when his salvation and his nemesis, his
	great black battle-blade Stormbringer, drank their souls.

		[ Crime and Punishment, by Fyodor Dostoevsky ]
	Dorothy leaned her chin upon her hand and gazed thoughtfully
	at the Scarecrow.  Its head was a small sack stuffed with
	straw, with eyes, nose, and mouth painted on it to represent
	a face.  An old, pointed blue hat, that had belonged to some
	Munchkin, was perched on his head, and the rest of the figure
	was a blue suit of clothes, worn and faded, which had also
	been stuffed with straw.  On the feet were some old boots with
	blue tops, such as every man wore in this country, and the
	figure was raised above the stalks of corn by means of the
	pole stuck up its back.

	The Egyptian god of the moon and wisdom, Thoth is the patron
	deity of scribes and of knowledge, including scientific,
	medical and mathematical writing, and is said to have given
	mankind the art of hieroglyphic writing.  He is important as
	a mediator and counsellor amongst the gods and is the scribe
	of the Heliopolis Ennead pantheon.  According to mythology,
	he was born from the head of the god Seth.  He may be
	depicted in human form with the head of an ibis, wholly as an
	ibis, or as a seated baboon sometimes with its torso covered
	in feathers.  His attributes include a crown which consists
	of a crescent moon surmounted by a moon disc.
	Thoth is generally regarded as a benign deity.  He is also
	scrupulously fair and is responsible not only for entering
	in the record the souls who pass to afterlife, but of
	adjudicating in the Hall of the Two Truths.  The Pyramid
	Texts reveal a violent side of his nature by which he
	decapitates the adversaries of truth and wrenches out their
	hearts.

	Methought I saw the footsteps of a throne
	Which mists and vapours from mine eyes did shroud--
	Nor view of who might sit thereon allowed;
	But all the steps and ground about were strown
	With sights the ruefullest that flesh and bone
	Ever put on; a miserable crowd,
	Sick, hale, old, young, who cried before that cloud,
	"Thou art our king,
	O Death! to thee we groan."
	Those steps I clomb; the mists before me gave
	Smooth way; and I beheld the face of one
	Sleeping alone within a mossy cave,

	Less than thirty Cat tribes now survived, roaming the cargo
	decks on their hind legs in a desperate search for food.
	But the food had gone.
	The supplies were finished.
	Weak and ailing, they prayed at the supply hold's silver
	mountains: huge towering acres of metal rocks which, in their
	pagan way, the mutant Cats believed watched over them.
	Amid the wailing and the screeching one Cat stood up and held
	aloft the sacred icon.  The icon which had been passed down
	as holy, and one day would make its use known.
	It was a piece of V-shaped metal with a revolving handle on
	its head.
	He took down a silver rock from the silver mountain, while
	the other Cats cowered and screamed at the blasphemy.
	He placed the icon on the rim of the rock, and turned the
	handle.
	And the handle turned.
	And the rock opened.
	And inside the rock was Alphabetti spaghetti in tomato sauce.

	and the Cyclops, were banished to the nether world.  Their
	enraged mother eventually released the youngest titan,

	(BMgc, Unseen University [failed]).  It was one of a number
	he had picked up since leaving the charred ruins of
	Ankh-Morpork.  Quaint was another one.  Picturesque meant --
	he decided after careful observation of the scenery that
	inspired Twoflower to use the word -- that the landscape was
	horribly precipitous.  Quaint, when used to describe the
	occasional village through which they passed, meant fever-
	ridden and tumbledown.
	Twoflower was a tourist, the first ever seen on the discworld.
	Tourist, Rincewind had decided, meant "idiot".

	The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy has a few things to say
	on the subject of towels.
	A towel, it says, is about the most massively useful thing
	an interstellar hitchhiker can have.  Partly it has great
	practical value.  You can wrap it around you for warmth as
	you bound across the cold moons of Jaglan Beta; you can lie
	on it on the brilliant marble-sanded beaches of Santraginus
	V, inhaling the heady sea vapors; you can sleep under it
	beneath the stars which shine so redly on the desert world
	of Kakrafoon; use it to sail a miniraft down the slow heavy
	River Moth; wet it for use in hand-to-hand combat; wrap it
	round your head to ward off noxious fumes or avoid the gaze
	of the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal (a mind-bogglingly
	stupid animal, it assumes that if you can't see it, it can't
	see you - daft as a brush, but very very ravenous); you can
	wave your towel in emergencies as a distress signal, and of
	course dry yourself off with it if it still seems to be clean
	enough.

	If you start from scratch, cooking tripe is a long-drawn-out

	To prepare fresh tripe, trim if necessary.  Wash it thoroughly,
	soaking overnight, and blanch, for 1/2 hour in salted water.
	Wash well again, drain and cut for cooking.  When cooked, the
	texture of tripe should be like that of soft gristle.  More
	often, alas, because the heat has not been kept low enough,
	it has the consistency of wet shoe leather.

	The troll shambled closer.  He was perhaps eight feet tall,
	perhaps more.  His forward stoop, with arms dangling past
	thick claw-footed legs to the ground, made it hard to tell.
	The hairless green skin moved upon his body.  His head was a
	gash of a mouth, a yard-long nose, and two eyes which drank

	Yet remains that one of the Aesir who is called Tyr:
	he is most daring, and best in stoutness of heart, and he
	has much authority over victory in battle; it is good for
	men of valor to invoke him.  It is a proverb, that he is
	Tyr-valiant, who surpasses other men and does not waver.
	He is wise, so that it is also said, that he that is wisest
	is Tyr-prudent.  This is one token of his daring:  when the
	Aesir enticed Fenris-Wolf to take upon him the fetter Gleipnir,
	the wolf did not believe them, that they would loose him,
	until they laid Tyr's hand into his mouth as a pledge.  But

	Men have always sought the elusive unicorn, for the single
	twisted horn which projected from its forehead was thought to
	be a powerful talisman.  It was said that the unicorn had
	simply to dip the tip of its horn in a muddy pool for the water
	to become pure.  Men also believed that to drink from this horn
	was a protection against all sickness, and that if the horn was
	ground to a powder it would act as an antidote to all poisons.
	Less than 200 years ago in France, the horn of a unicorn was
	used in a ceremony to test the royal food for poison.

	Although only the size of a small horse, the unicorn is a very
	fierce beast, capable of killing an elephant with a single
	thrust from its horn.  Its fleetness of foot also makes this
	solitary creature difficult to capture.  However, it can be
	tamed and captured by a maiden.  Made gentle by the sight of a
	virgin, the unicorn can be lured to lay its head in her lap, and
	in this docile mood, the maiden may secure it with a golden rope.

	Venus, the goddess of love and beauty, was the daughter of
	Jupiter and Dione.  Others say that Venus sprang from the
	foam of the sea.  The zephyr wafted her along the waves to
	the Isle of Cyprus, where she was received and attired by
	the Seasons, and then led to the assembly of the gods.  All
	were charmed with her beauty, and each one demanded her
	for his wife.  Jupiter gave her to Vulcan, in gratitude for
	the service he had rendered in forging thunderbolts.  So
	the most beautiful of the goddesses became the wife of the

	Vlad Dracula the Impaler was a 15th-Century monarch of the

	One was his skilled handling of the Ottoman Turks, which kept
	them from making further inroads into Christian Europe.  The
	other was the ruthless manner in which he ran his fiefdom.
	He dealt with perceived challengers to his rule by impaling
	them upright on wooden stakes.  Visiting dignitaries who
	failed to doff their hats had them nailed to their head.
	Swirling clouds of pure elemental energies, the vortices are

	A wakizashi was used as a samurai's weapon when the katana
	was unavailable.  When entering a building, a samurai would
	leave his katana on a rack near the entrance.  However, the
	wakizashi would be worn at all times, and therefore, it made
	a sidearm for the samurai (similar to a soldier's use of a
	pistol).  The samurai would have worn it from the time they
	awoke to the time they went to sleep.  In earlier periods,
	and especially during times of civil wars, a tanto was worn
	in place of a wakizashi.

	[ The monkey king ] walked along the bank, around the pond.

	80,000 monkeys, "This pond is possessed by a water demon.  Do
	not let anybody go into it."

	After a little while, the water demon saw that none of the
	monkeys went into the water to drink.  So he rose out of the
	middle of the pond, taking the shape of a frightening monster.
	He had a big blue belly, a white face with bulging green eyes,
	and red claws and feet.  He said, "Why are you just sitting
	around?  Come into the pond and drink at once!"

	There were legends both on the front and on the back of the 
	whistle. The one read thus:

	FLA FUR BIS FLE The other: QUIS EST ISTE QUI VENIT 
	'I ought to be able to make it out,' he thought; 
	'but I suppose I am a little rusty in my Latin. 
	When I come to think of it, I don't believe I even 
	know the word for a whistle. The long one does seem 
	simple enough. It ought to mean, "Who is this who is coming?" 

	Well, the best way to find out is evidently to whistle 
	for him.'

		[Ghost Stories of an Antiquary, by Montague Rhodes James
		 'Oh, Whistle, and I'll Come to You My Lad']
	When he came to himself again, for a moment he could recall
	nothing except a sense of dread.  Then suddenly he knew that
	he was imprisoned, caught hopelessly; he was in a barrow.  A
	Barrow-wight had taken him, and he was probably already under
	the dreadful spells of the Barrow-wights about which whispered
	tales spoke.  He dared not move, but lay as he found himself:
	flat on his back upon a cold stone with his hands on his
	breast.
		[ The Fellowship of the Ring, by J.R.R. Tolkien ]
	Ebenezum walked before me along the closest thing we could
	find to a path in these overgrown woods.  Every few paces he
	would pause, so that I, burdened with a pack stuffed with
	arcane and heavy paraphernalia, could catch up with his
	wizardly strides.  He, as usual, carried nothing, preferring,
	as he often said, to keep his hands free for quick conjuring
	and his mind free for the thoughts of a mage.
		[ A Dealing with Demons, by Craig Shaw Gardner ]
	No one knows how old this mighty wizard is, or from whence he
	came.  It is known that, having lived a span far greater than
	any normal man's, he grew weary of lesser mortals; and so,
	spurning all human company, he forsook the dwellings of men
	and went to live in the depths of the Earth.  He took with
	him a dreadful artifact, the Book of the Dead, which is said
	to hold great power indeed.  Many have sought to find the
	wizard and his treasure, but none have found him and lived to
	tell the tale.  Woe be to the incautious adventurer who
	disturbs this mighty sorcerer!
	The ancestors of the modern day domestic dog, wolves are
	powerful muscular animals with bushy tails.  Intelligent,
	social animals, wolves live in family groups or packs made
	up of multiple family units.  These packs cooperate in hunting
	down prey.
	1.  Any of various, usually poisonous perennial herbs of the
	genus Aconitum, having tuberous roots, palmately lobed leaves,
	blue or white flowers with large hoodlike upper sepals, and an
	aggregate of follicles.  2.  The dried leaves and roots of
	some of these plants, which yield a poisonous alkaloid that
	was formerly used medicinally.  In both senses also called
	monkshood.
	[ The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language,
	  Fourth Edition. ]
	Come, old broomstick, you are needed,
	Take these rags and wrap them round you!
	Long my orders you have heeded,
	By my wishes now I've bound you.
	Have two legs and stand,
	And a head for you.
	Run, and in your hand
	Hold a bucket too.
	...
	See him, toward the shore he's racing
	There, he's at the stream already,
	Back like lightning he is chasing,
	Pouring water fast and steady.
	Once again he hastens!
	How the water spills,
	How the water basins
	Brimming full he fills!
	[ The Sorcerer's Apprentice, by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,
	  translation by Edwin Zeydel ]
	The Usenet Oracle requires an answer to this question!

	> How much wood could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could
	> chuck wood?

	"Oh, heck!  I'll handle *this* one!"  The Oracle spun the terminal
	back toward himself, unlocked the ZOT-guard lock, and slid the
	glass guard away from the ZOT key.  "Ummmm....could you turn around
	for a minute?  ZOTs are too graphic for the uninitiated.  Even *I*
	get a little squeamish sometimes..."  The neophyte turned around,
	and heard the Oracle slam his finger on a computer key, followed
	by a loud ZZZZOTTTTT and the smell of ozone.
		[ Excerpted from Internet Oracularity 576.6 ]
	[The crysknife] is manufactured in two forms from teeth taken
	from dead sandworms.  The two forms are "fixed" and "unfixed".
	An unfixed knife requires proximity to a human body's
	electrical field to prevent disintegration.  Fixed knives
	are treated for storage.  All are about 20 centimeters long.
		[ Dune, by Frank Herbert ]
	Immediately, though everything else remained as before, dim
	and dark, the shapes became terribly clear.  He was able to
	see beneath their black wrappings.  There were five tall
	figures:  two standing on the lip of the dell, three advancing.
	In their white faces burned keen and merciless eyes; under
	their mantles were long grey robes; upon their grey hairs
	were helms of silver; in their haggard hands were swords of
	steel.  Their eyes fell on him and pierced him, as they
	rushed towards him.  Desperate, he drew his own sword, and
	it seemed to him that it flickered red, as if it was a
	firebrand.  Two of the figures halted.  The third was taller
	than the others:  his hair was long and gleaming and on his
	helm was a crown.  In one hand he held a long sword, and in
	the other a knife; both the knife and the hand that held it
	glowed with a pale light.  He sprang forward and bore down
	on Frodo.
		[ The Fellowship of the Ring, by J.R.R. Tolkien ]
	The Wumpus, by the way, is not bothered by the hazards since
	he has sucker feet and is too big for a bat to lift.  If you
	try to shoot him and miss, there's also a chance that he'll
	up and move himself into another cave, though by nature the
	Wumpus is a sedentary creature.
		[ wump (6) -- "Hunt the Wumpus" ]

	_Wumpus yobgregorii_, in the flesh...
	Later, all you will be able to remember are its eyes.  They
	are rich mud-brown, and they hold your own without effort.
		[ Hunter, In Darkness, by Andrew Plotkin ]
	They sent their friend the mosquito [xan] ahead of them to
	find out what lay ahead.  "Since you are the one who sucks
	the blood of men walking along paths," they told the mosquito,
	"go and sting the men of Xibalba."  The mosquito flew
	down the dark road to the Underworld.  Entering the house of
	the Lords of Death, he stung the first person that he saw...

	The mosquito stung this man as well, and when he yelled, the
	man next to him asked, "Gathered Blood, what's wrong?"  So
	he flew along the row stinging all the seated men until he
	knew the names of all twelve.
			[ Popul Vuh, as translated by Ralph Nelson ]
	A distant cousin of the earth elemental, the xorn has the
	ability to shift the cells of its body around in such a way
	that it becomes porous to inert material.  This gives it the
	ability to pass through any obstacle that might be between it
	and its next meal.
	The arrow of choice of the samurai, ya are made of very
	straight bamboo, and are tipped with hardened steel.
	Yeenoghu, the demon lord of gnolls, still exists although
	all his followers have been wiped off the face of the earth.
	He casts magic projectiles at those close to him, and a mere
	gaze into his piercing eyes may hopelessly confuse the
	battle-weary adventurer.
	The Abominable Snowman, or yeti, is one of the truly great
	unknown animals of the twentieth century.  It is a large hairy
	biped that lives in the Himalayan region of Asia ... The story
	of the Abominable Snowman is filled with mysteries great and
	small, and one of the most difficult of all is how it got that
	awful name.  The creature is neither particularly abominable,
	nor does it necessarily live in the snows.  _Yeti_ is a Tibetan
	word which may apply either to a real, but unknown animal of
	the Himalayas, or to a mountain spirit or demon -- no one is
	quite sure which.  And after nearly half a century in which
	Westerners have trampled around looking for the yeti, and
	asking all sorts of questions, the original native traditions
	concerning the creature have become even more muddled and
	confused.
		[ The Encyclopedia of Monsters, by Daniel Cohen ]
	Japanese leather archery gloves.  Gloves made for use while
	practicing had thumbs reinforced with horn.  Those worn into
	battle had thumbs reinforced with a double layer of leather.
	The samurai is highly trained with a special type of bow,
	the yumi.  Like the ya, the yumi is made of bamboo.  With
	the yumi-ya, the bow and arrow, the samurai is an extremely
	accurate and deadly warrior.
	The zombi... is a soulless human corpse, still dead, but
	taken from the grave and endowed by sorcery with a
	mechanical semblance of life, -- it is a dead body which is
	made to walk and act and move as if it were alive.
		[ W. B. Seabrook ]
	The zruty are wild and gigantic beings, living in the
	wildernesses of the Tatra mountains.
